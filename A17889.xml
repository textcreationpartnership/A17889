         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>OTH in the begining, and in the end of this booke, I render à reaſon, ample enough, of the ſubiect which gaue it birth; And I ſatisfie (me thinkes) the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which may be made againſt many points therin by me handled, which might haue ſerued for matter, and ornament to à preface. I touch here many nice and delicate ſtrings, the euent wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will proue as it shall pleaſe the diuine Prouidence. I cannot war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it, I may onely here aſſure in words of veritie, and Charitie, not fayned; that my intention was
<pb facs="tcp:7959:5"/> ſincere, and without paſſion, in compoſing this worke, and that I rather thought therby to ſerue God in my neigbour, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice any. This is onely as it were à Commentary vpon the third Chap: of the firſt part of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothea of my B. Father Francis of Sales, Bishop of Geneua; and though I giue à Carreere large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough vnto my ſpirit, ſuffering it to runne into the Chriſtian libertie of its thoughts, I beleeue neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, not to haue ſwarued from the <hi>conceipts</hi> of this holie Prelat, from whoſe mouth, I haue her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore heard things which had euen as much quicknes, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, (not to ſaie rigour) as thoſe which I here produce, albeit he had milke, and honny vnder the tongue, and that his words, no leſſe then his manners were ſteeped
<pb facs="tcp:7959:5"/> in an incomparable ſweetnes. If I mingle here wine with oyle in imitation of the good Samatitan, it is to heale the wounds which haue neede of this dreſſing, and where ſuauitie ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaigned with à wholſome bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes. My principall intention in this litle worke is, to furnish deuout ſoules with à touchſtone to diſcerne the true from the falſe Directour, by the marke of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, of his Dis-intereſſed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. I here ſet downe artes to know the pure alloie, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish it from the ſophiſticall, to the end we may become good <hi>coyners</hi> according to the counſell which ſome auntient Fathers ſaie to haue flowed from the mouth of our lord. To giue aſſiſtance to this choiſe, I framed this addreſſe; Choiſe of ſo much importance, as
<pb facs="tcp:7959:6"/> there are few practiſes in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life which in neceſſity ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it. I preſent vnto thee here, READER, neere ſighted ſpectacles to ſee things at à ſmall diſtance, which thou peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture haſt neuer well perceaued by reaſon of their remotenes, there being queſtion of many acts, for the moſt part hidden, and diuerted from the knowledge of the vulgar. Reade this without other Intereſt, then the glorie of God, and thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by à preocupate opinion; and when thou shalt haue mett, in à Directour, with the qualities which I note vnto thee in this booke, feare not to commit thy barke, to the guidance of ſuch à Pilot; For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vnder the winde of heauenly grace, he will cauſe it to arriue at the hauen of ſaluation, &amp; immortality.
<pb facs="tcp:7959:6"/> To conclude, I ſubmit with all my hart, both this treatiſe, and all thoſe which haue, or may iſſue, by the aſſiſtance of God, from my ſpirit, and from my pen, vnto the iudgement, and to the correction, not onely of the holie Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of her viſible Head, the chiefe Bishop, but alſo of her Doctours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom I reuerence as my Maiſters.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning Directors who heare not Confeſsions.</head>
                  <p>I Could neuer finde it good, that Confeſſors should not direct: Nor that they who meddle in directing should not receaue Confeſſions. I cannot likewiſe comprehend, how Directors who will not heare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, can profitablely meddle in giueing councell in à pratick, Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they hade onely à cold and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall Theory: Nor conceaue the ſtupide and indiſcreete patience of Confeſſors, who ſee their hony ſpoiled by droanes which cannot makit; Who onely deale in à trade, wherof they are wholy ignorant. I ſpeake not without ground, with this litle touch and motion of Zeale,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7959:16"/> becauſe the experience of. 25. yeares both publiquely, and priuately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, with ſufficient attention vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of ſoules, made me knowe, that ſome pull downe more by ignorance, then by malice, that which the ſcience of others erects in good conſciences with much labour. I doe not ſay that theſe companies which abſteine from heareing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions doe ill: No truely, becauſe to ſpeake properly, this office is more Paſtorall, then <hi>Cenobiticall;</hi> ſeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the ſame tends to the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their <hi>Clausteriall</hi> diſcipline, which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue would therby be diſſipated and relaxed, though other Congregations no leſſe auſteere, &amp; reformed; and who proforme this function, with much fruite &amp; edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not of the ſame opinion; grounded vpon this ſayenig of the <hi>Apoſtole,</hi> That <hi>Charitie</hi> ſeekes rather the aduauncement of Gods glory,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7959:16"/> then its proper <hi>intereſt.</hi> But that which I finde of difficultie, is, that the vnexpertnes in an occupation which is the arte of artes (ſince it is the guidance of ſoules wholly internall, and in the face of God) cauſeth them to put their ſickle into an others har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, and by their directions to ſpoile (who cannot without the ſeale of Confeſſion be very internall) the wholſome and holy <hi>Economie</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</hi> I verily beleeue they haue no intent to doe ill; for who could iudge otherwiſe then well of the good intentions of ſuch, as by the auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their liues caſt forth the good odour in Ieſus-Chriſt, lyke vnto that of the Myrrhe, which diſtills from the wounded tree. A compariſon which the eternall wiſedome takes to it ſelf. But I know well, that the ſucceſſe of things doth not alwayes anſweare the intentions: And that <hi>S. Paul</hi> did not alwayes act the good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7959:17"/> which he would, and that he was ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the cauſe of euill, which he willed not. I ſpeake boldly in this for as much as it is of certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. I thinke then, it would be to the purpoſe, to shew vnto theis our Maiſters the DIRECTORS, ſo ſeuere to their bodyes, and ſo delicate in their ſpirits, and who are content to eate the ſinnes of the people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the paine or yrkſomnes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reing them; that they should either wholly dedicate them ſelues to this practiſe, as the other auſteere and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed orders very worthily doe, should enter into the powers of our lord, and viſit the interiour <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with the ſerching lampes at the Tribunall of <hi>Penance;</hi> or that without embroileing the labours of the skilfull with their aduiſe which they deliuer as Oracles, yſſueing from the horne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; They should containe them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7959:17"/> ſelues in à deuoute ſilence, which would be farr more perfect. &amp; profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, then to intrude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into families, &amp; conſciences, trayning into captiuity ſimple ſoules, loaden with ſinne, ledd by diuers deſires, and continually learning, without being able to arriue to the knowledge of Truth. Charitie, without emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or contention, hath preſt me to make this cenſure; Which is not yet ſo ſtronge, as the caſe deſerues; for as much as there ariſe from theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions, ſundry impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to hinder the aduancement of many ſoules in the way of God. And his dinine goodnes gruant, that this ſeemeing <hi>Pietie,</hi> which tends to particular profitt, hurt not the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular profitt of true <hi>Pietie,</hi> which alone can ſay with the Apoſtle, Tis you that I ſeeke, not yours, Tis your ſoule, and not your goods.

                  <p>NEither would I yet by blameing this varietie auoid one gulfe to run into another. All extreamitie is naught. I would not willingly take away from à ſoule, the libertie of ſearcheing euery where, for able and pious men, to conferr with them about the affayres of her ſaluation. For though the Scripture placeth Knowledge and the Lawe in the Mouth of the Preiſt (note this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) and putteth euery word to be determined in the Mouth of two or three: yet neuertheles other where it ſayes, that ſaluation conſiſts in diuerſe counſells; There are neuer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7959:18"/> too many when they are good; and then are they ſuch, when they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not one another, ſtrugling like <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> Lett the ſoule then remayne in full libertie, for this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; becauſe where the ſpirit of God dwells ther is the true libertie: Libertie of the children of God; Children of the Free, not of the Bondſlaue; and who haue not the ſpirit of ſeruitude, but that of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which makes them cry <hi>Abba Pater.</hi> Onely let diſcretion, the ſalt and ſeaſoning of all vertues, ſerue it for à Torch to auoied the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which are found both in the vnitie, and multiplicitie, the ſame being ſubject to daungerous tyes, and to an Empire on the one ſide, and à Thraldome on the other; which make, the yoake inſupportable, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is forced. And this engulfeing à ſoule into the trouble of incertitude, reſembles theſe trauellers, who lodge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7959:19"/> euery where, &amp; reſt no where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe Bees which make no hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when the ſpring ouer-abounds in flowers, becauſe the delight they take in flying vp and downe, cauſeth them to forgett to retourne into their hiues, and there to lay vp pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for winter. If ſome time it bee needefull for à ſoule to be thus diuided, betwixt à DIRECTOR, and à CONEESSOR, at leaſt let theſe two perſons be both learned, both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute, both expert, both charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and wnanimouſly conſpireing to the good of that ſoule, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7959:20"/> by two different guidances, what can it hope for, but to dye vnder ſo cruell à torment? and to finde his punishment euen there, where it ought to expect conſolation, and its direction vnto grace? I haue ſett forth that which is already ſpoken, vpon the ſubiect of this pious ſoule, wearied in this manner by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions of thoſe who did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it, and like vnto à shipp that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde the porte, being toſſed to &amp; froe, at an inſtant by two contrary windes. Haueing therfore compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its payne, which onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exceſſe of Meekenes, feare, and docilitie, I thought my ſelfe obliged to correſpond by my ſlender aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, which it teſtified to repoſe both in my publique, and priuate ſpeahes. I tooke then vpon me this care, amongſt diuerſe others; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeing my dayly imployements
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7959:20"/> in preaching, I repaired at certaine houres, to the Tribunall of <hi>Penance,</hi> which is in the church, as à Poole for sheepe, and as the Founteine of the houſe of Iacob, applied to the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane imperfections: I found this ſoule then in ſuch ſorte loſt in ſeruile feare, and all worne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with ſcruples, bredd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of theſe guides, as being ledd by force it knew not well what way it went, ſo contrary was it vnto it ſelfe. The payne which I tooke to reſtore its ſpirit vnto à quiett and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeate, God he knoweth, that in my retirement I caſt my thoughts on this ſoule, and that I ardently prayed for its conſolation. In the end God heard the preparation of its heart, and diſperſeing theſe obſcurities, and diſcontents, cauſed the ſplendour of his face to shine vpon it and rendred it the Ioy of its ſaluation, &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meing it with his principall ſpirit.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7959:21"/> Theis feares too ſeruile, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as much ſwolne with ſelf-loue, as voide of diuine dilection, by litle and litle, diſſolue them ſelues, and charitie being diffuſed by the holy Ghoſt into its heart, this ſtarr whoſe influences are ſo benigne, made, like the ſunne in the ſpring, to open the flowers in the lande of its interiour. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſacred vertue, Queene of all others, had ſomwhat dilated its ſoule, the exceſſiue terrous, as the shadowes of the night, became diſperſed by its amiable b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This I knowe, and with aſſurance, that he had farr more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the conduct of ſoules at the Tribunall of <hi>Penance,</hi> then the DIRECTOR; though he beleeud it not; and that the DIRECTOR con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, eſteemed himſelf much more fitt then he, and endeuored like à Pedant vpon all occaſions, to gouerne both him, and the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Soule with à browe farr more humbleing, then humble; and who had much more of the Phariſie, then of the Publican. When this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7959:26"/> good Preiſt gaue vnto this pious Soule ſome ſpirituall aduiſe, which he conceiued profitable, she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently related it vnto the DIREC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR, as vnto her touch-ſtone; yf it pleaſed not this Preacher, he declamed againſt it with full voyce, and with ſuch ſcornefull, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing tearmes, no leſſe vnbeſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge the mouth which vttered them; then honorable vnto the modeſtie and patience of him, vnto whom they were addreſſed. How ofte had the auſteere Empire of this ſufficient DIRECTOR cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Penitent perſon to forſake her CONEESSOR, yf he had not bene affrayed to looſe the abſurd practiſe of his loftie <hi>Theorie,</hi> and that the ſtreames of this ſource, should haue bene ſpent vpon other Meadowes then thoſe of his owne houſe? And then ſeeing himſelf to haue gotten the abſolute dominion, both ouer
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7959:26"/> the ſpirit of the Penitent, and the CONFESSOR, it delighted him to ouerthrowe with the impetuous blaſt of his mouth, all whatſoeuer the other had endeuored to buid vp ſolid: and to pluck vp whatſoeuer he had planted, before it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any deepe roote, ſeldome giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant condition of this poore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and of à man litle verſed in theſe Anagogies (for this word pleaſed him) of the ſupereſſentiall, &amp; ſupereminent life.

To conclude, he made vſe verie authentically of the priuiledge which the Apoſtle giues vnto the ſpirituall man, which is to Iudge all others, and not to be Iudged by any. When I had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered this whole miſterie (which certes was not of iniquity yet where I noted à manifeſt injuſtice) I placed my ſelf on that ſide, which I eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the more luſt according to the imitation of our ſauiour, who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the penitent <hi>Mary</hi> againſt the cenſure of the Phariſie.

As I was then meditateing on my retourne vnto my reſidence, I remitted this Soule, healed of her ſcruples and vexations, into the armes of the heauenly Prouidence, haueing giuen her for à rule and leuell of perfection in her voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Philothea</hi> of my bleſſed father, aſſuring her that if she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued this rule, she should liue
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7959:34"/> before God in ſanctitie and Iuſtice, both now and in all eternitie. And haueing cauſed her retourne vnto her <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> whom I found to be an excellent man, and very able to guide her; I aſſured her, that followeing his counſelle and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which I iudged very good and wholſome, and walkeing ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and confidently vnder this conduct, she could not but, arriue at à ſecure harbor. I told her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides plainely and roundly, that I did not approue of this double guide, of à <hi>Confeſſor</hi> and <hi>Director</hi> at one time, vnleſse the <hi>Director</hi> were as well verſed as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> in the practiſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Penance,</hi> and made ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary profeſſion therof: moreouer I required in this <hi>Director,</hi> ſo much aduantage both in ſcience, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, aboue the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> that he were able to be his maiſter; So
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7959:34"/> that the opinions both of the one and the other might not ſo combatt one another, that the ſpirit of the partie directed, should ſtand doubtfull and diuided in it ſelfe: further, though I would not take parte with inconſtancie, knowing that one of the Prophetes makes inſtablitie to be à punishment of the ſinnes of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles in the act of <hi>Penance,</hi> and the interiour, I ſided with libertie; and as I did not finde fault with the tyeing ones ſelf to one <hi>Confeſſor</hi> or <hi>Director</hi> ſo that diſtraction were eaſily auoyded: Soe neither did I commend that voluntary ſeruitude, not being ignorant, that either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie might be vitious. And as in the one it were to relye too much vpon à creature, malediction being pronounced in holy writte againſt him that truſts in man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and putts his confidence in the

This I shewed her by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of two holy Congregations of Woemen', the one of <hi>Carmelites,</hi> whoſe holy and Angelicall life caſts forth à ſacred odor in IESVS-CHRIST which embaulmes the whole church: The other of S.

But who knows not, that there is nothing ſo

If then ſuch à libertie be giuen vnto women, both reformed and incloſed, liueing vnder à farre more ſtrict diſcipline, then à ſecular perſon who hath its Soule in its owne hands, why might not she then iuſtly mak vſe (with the bleſſing of God) of ſo honeſt, and profitable à licence, conſulting with diuerſe Oracles, and according to the Apoſtle, makeing triall of many ſpiritts, not to tye her ſelf vnto any but the good? It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my opinion à thing no leſſe tormenting, and daungerous, ſo to oblige oneſelfe vnto à <hi>Director,</hi> or <hi>Confeſſor</hi> as not to endure the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or relish of an other: as to chaunge euery daye without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeing vpon any one. Wherfore this aduiſe of an auntient wiſeman, who would that me should loue ſo, as if we should one day hate, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7959:36"/> that we should hate, as if we should one daye loue, ſeemes to me may well be practiſed in the ſubiect wherof I ſpeake, in ſuffering ones ſelf to be ſpiritually guided by à <hi>Director</hi> or <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> as if the next day he were to looſe him (which happenes euery daye in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tranſmigration which the conuentalls make. And ſo to leaue any one, as if shorte time, he were to giue him ſelf vp againe to his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. By this meanes he shall preſerue his ſpirit in a perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, which conſiſteth in à totall diſingageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all that is not God, what ſoeuer pretence he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue not to regard any creature, but in God, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for God, and in ſome relation which the thing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hath to the Creatour. For to conclude, no man can ſerue two Maiſters, It is neceſſary that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueing but one heart, it should dwell
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7959:37"/> in God alone; The bedd is to ſtrait the couering to shorte, two cannot remaine couered therin. Ah! Let God liue, and who is like vnto God? And who would not breake all other chaines, but that chaine of perfection which linkes vs vnto him? O liberty of my heart, thou art too generous euer to ſubiect thy ſelf to any other then to God alone, or to regard any will but his, In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baying thoſe whom he hath giuen vs for Superiours, and placed ouer vs, to whom he commaundeth the ſame obedience as to him ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeakes vnto vs by them, and who heareth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, heareth him, and who deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth him.

By the loue then of concupiſcence, we affect in another our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in regard of the pleaſure, honour, and profit, which we expect or drawe from thence.

But who doth ſimplie good to performe an act acceptable vnto God; ſince the Pſalmiſt him ſelf (à man according to Gods owne hearte) auoweth that his heart was carried towards the works of Iuſtice, in reſpect of the recompence which he hoped for?

For this ſacred oyle, this pretious Balme looſeth its odour, and value, when the ſame is mingled with the liquour of any other pretence whatſouer, then that of the glory of God, in whom, by whom, and for whom we loue and ſerue others. And it is in this ſorte that God hath recommended our

Truely how ſpirituall ſoeuer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man be, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue himſelf to be, it is neceſſary carefully to remember that he is inuironed with infirmitie, that the ſpirit is prompt, but the flesh feeble; that he is flesh ioyned vnto à ſpirit, which tends of it ſelf to Sinne, through an inclination which the ſenſe receaues from its origine; but retournes not from thence, nor is raiſed vp by its owne proper forces. Here it is, where, according to the Apoſtle, we ought to walke prudently, and as it were vpon the ashes which couer the embers. The Sanctitie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Wiſe-dome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon</hi> proue in this dangerous incounter, but miſery, but folly, but Weaknes.

The ſame is ſo shadowed and ſubiect to eluſion, as often times vnder the cloake of Charitie, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is offended; and, as the Apes their younge ones, we ſtrangle by too much embraceing. Take it not that way, you think no euell, but the diuill is alwayes there to thinke for you, and continually layes am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſches at your heeles, and for the weaker part, and leſſe defended: Tis to handle an artificiall fire, which burnes when we leaſt imagine. There is no truſting of à Serpent, it may come to paſſe that he ſting you not (ſayth <hi>S.

But I will preſſe this <hi>Intereſt</hi> no farther; becauſe it is the moſt couered, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7959:57"/> moſt hard of all, in the ſubiect I treate of; but ſuch, as ſometimes ſparkling forth, cauſeth the greater ſcandalls, and for which no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rigourous enough can be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned. I will beleeue that God hath à particular care to preſerue from ordures this founteine of the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ordeyned for the purifieing of vncleane perſons. Wee likewiſe ſee that our ſauiour who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of his Apoſtles, by the ambitious, couetous, vſurers, blaſphemers, perſecutors, wratfull, indiſcreete, incredulous; could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer indure à perſon ſuſpected of any dishoneſtie. It was demanded of Plato, why in his lawes he had not ordeined ſome punishment againſt Patricides; becauſe (ſayd he) I doe not beleeue that nature produceth ſuch horrible monſters. And when one demaunded on à certaine time of à Lacedemonian, what was the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7959:57"/> condemnation of Adulterers in Sparta, he anſweared merrily, to pay à Bull, who had à neck longe enough to be able euen from the topp of the mount Tayge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, to drinke of the riuer Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and it being replied, that it was impoſſible to finde ſuch an animall, It is no leſſe hard (replied agayne the other) to finde an adulterer in Lacedemonia. For my parte I thinke, that the like ought to be ſayd of thoſe of whom I ſpeake, and that à man muſt needes be worſe then à diuell, and extreamely wicked, to abuſe the remedie of all euills, and to make poiſon of the Antidote. It is à ſmall matter to ſay that ſuch as should become ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, would procure therby their owne damnation, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes of thoſe who after the vowe of continencie, followe the deſires of ſenſuality, couering their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7959:58"/> fault with the Vayle of an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrament. But one may ſay that they neede à particular hell, or that there is no chaſtiſement rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough, to punish à crime which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be committed without horrible ſacriledge, nor named without deteſtation.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7959:71"/> which ſome ſeeke to eſtablish is much ſuſpected of tirannie. This bitter zeale reprehended by S. <hi>Iames</hi> which breedes contentions proceedes from à wiſedome which is not from aboue, but earthly.

                  <p>LET vs conclude this character of <hi>honorable Intereſt</hi> with this paſſage; which in my opinion as it is the more remarkable, ſo is it the more euitable. The ſame, is when à <hi>Director</hi> of what condition ſoeuer of Cenobite ſeekes by his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to entangle à ſoule in obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Vowes of Obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, or locall, that is, to confine it to à certaine place vnto the <hi>Directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> of a particular Order, deſireing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of the greater me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt, or more ample perfection to range it vnder the lawes, which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish an interiour Empire, to the preiudice ſometimes of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon guided. From
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7959:93"/> thence one falls into à blinde Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, laudable peraduenture in ſome caſe (for I knowe that grau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and holy Authours haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, makeing vſe of the examples of Iſaac, and the daugter of Iephte) but daungerous in many others, if therebe no exception of things commaunded, and forbidden by God himſelfe, whome we muſt rather obey then men; for as much as it is ſubiect to be led into precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if the guide who directs it be not well aſſured. I know that here ſome alledge wonders, and that the ſcripture ſeemes to thunder from all partes againſt proper Wiſdome, proper Will, proper motion, that thoſe who think them ſelues wiſe, are truely fooles; that, we ought to be as litle children: that the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient man ſpeakes of victories; that Obedience is better then Sacrifice; that our Sauiour rendered himſelf
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7959:93"/> obedient euen vnto the Croſſe; that he who walkes plainely, walketh confidently, and à thouſand ſuch like allegations. But likewiſe on the other ſide, when we are aduiſed to mingle the Prudence of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with the ſimplicity of the doue, it ſeemes that obedience takes not away the ſpirit of diſcerning, which makes vs to render vnto God, and vnto thoſe who hold his place ouer vs, à reaſonable ſeruice. If one beate our eares with this ſayeing of Dauid, I was made O lord as à horſe vnder you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am alwayes with you, cannot we replie with the ſame Prophett, man being placed in honour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode not his dignitie, for which cauſe he hath bene compared vnto horſes, and made like vnto them? When they who diue into the Sea to fish for Pearles, deſcende into the hollow places, they there cauſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7959:94"/> light by oyle which they carrie in their mouths: To finde the pearle of perfection in à particular Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, I conceaue that the oyle of diſcretion is therin moſt neceſſary, that we may cleerely ſee what we doe; otherwiſe in ſteede of growing rich in Vertues, we runn the hazard to become like that inconſiderate of the Apocalips, poore, naked, and miſerable. You ſee well that I ſpeak heere of à ſpeciall obedience, of à particular ſoule vnto à particular <hi>Director,</hi> not of that which is made in the ſolemne, and publick Vowe of the Cenobiticall life. For though this ſame hath neede of ſome kinde of light to diſcerne, whether that which is commaunded by the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour be not contrary to the diuine lawe; In all that is indifferent to be performed, it neede not be had. But the other is much more in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his owne counſell, and ought
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7959:94"/> to walke with much more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, euen in ſuch things as ſeeme indifferent, and as if it mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on flowers, where ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente might lay ambushes at its heeles. What? (will one ſay) can you finde fault with the ſimple and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Vowes of particular obedience, which ſo many holy ſoules haue made vnto their <hi>Directors,</hi> of which the examples are reported by the bleſſed Francis of Sales in the 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chapter of the firſt parte of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothea? Thankes be to God, I think I haue ſome practiſe in that book, as alſo ſome knowledge of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that holy Author: But to take that place preciſely, he brings onely one of S. Elizabeth of Hungarie who putt her-ſelf vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Doctor Conradus, with an extraordinary ſubmiſſion; he ſpeakes nothing of à Vowe. Marrie he addes indeede, that S. Tereſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:7959:95"/> beſides the vow of Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which she, as Religious, had made vnto her Superiours, made yet à à particular vow, vnto one of her Confeſſors, which is à ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Pietie, laudable truely in this greate Saint, but which would not be ſo peraduenture in another. For in à Monaſterie of women, what Superiour would approue, that one of the Siſters should make the like vowe of ſpeciall Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which cauſeth me to anſweare by this auntient Prouerbe, that one Swallowe makes no ſummer, nor à particular action à generall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let vs ſay then, that this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection made by à ſetled purpoſe, or by vowe, may be good when it proceedes from the franke, pure, and free will of the perſon that ſubiecteth himſelf, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, precipitation, perſwaſion, or induction; euen as the firſt Mirrhe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7959:95"/> which commeth out of the tree, by way of ſweete gumme, or diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is much more eſteemed then the ſecond, that is drawen out by inſciſions, ſcrapeing, or ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the rinde. Wherfore the <hi>Spirituall Director truely dis-intereſſed,</hi> doth not onely not exact, nor euer perſwade ſuch an obligation and Obedience, but when feruour ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts it vnto the ſoule, vnder his conduct, he makes longe triall, whether this motion preceede from the ſpirit of God, or from ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreete, and immoderate zeale: and doth not inconſiderately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt this tye to be made, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Image of Sanctitie the action made by the Vow, of it ſelfe doe beare. For albeit on the one ſide à good work receaues ſome augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Value, according to all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7959:96"/> on the other parte there is often daunger, and alwayes Iealouſie of ſome impertinent obligation. And it is needefull that the <hi>Director</hi> be like an honeſt woman, not onely free from all euill, but alſo from any ſuſpition therof: the integritie of reputation, or rather the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of à perfect integritie, being extreamely neceſſarie in ſoules to ſerue God with profitt and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I knowe à ſoule which being willing to oblige it ſelf by Vowe to performe ſome act of Pietie, was diſſwaded from it by the B. Francis of Sales, one of the moſt holy, and moſt <hi>dis-intereſſed Directors</hi> that euer was: Notwithſtanding he did not therby hinder it in the execution of that act, which ought to be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery day, contrariwiſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the continuation of the ſame by conſtant purpoſe and firme reſolution: But he was not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7959:96"/> that à vowe should be therin vſed, becauſe (ſayd he) vowed actions, though of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture excellent, yet by accident are they ſubiect to greate ſcruples &amp; perplexities. I would willingly lay open the conceit of this holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who was not onely à man, but à Seraphin on earth, and who had the guifts of counſell, intelligence, and of Wiſedome in à verie eminent degree, as his writeings doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie. I likewiſe know that he held at the triall of interiour mortification, and humiliation à greate and holy ſoule more then eight or nine yeares, before he would promitt it to make an entire retraite from the world, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it ſelf vnto God by an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute abandoning therof; and if his quiet, humble, and condiſcending ſpirit (if euer ther were any ſuch) had not yeelded vnto the opinions of à
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7959:97"/> greate Prelate; the holy Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath founded, had remained in the ſimple obligation, according to the firſt Inſtitution without paſſeing further into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vowes intituled <hi>An order vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rule of S. Auguſtine:</hi> So farr was this holy Paſtor from the ſpirit of conſtraint, and ſeruitude, ſo highely did he prize voluntary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and how greate an enimie was he vnto this domination which ſome <hi>Directors</hi> eſtablish ouer ſoules, by this ſo faire à way in apparence, and ſo aduantagious, by their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pretences. This is not in the leaſt ſort to derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of holy vowes, ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in holy ſcripture, and by all antiquitie. No truely, and who could doe it without ſacriledge, and blaſphemie? But neuertheles à man may ſay therof as of the Arke which was ſo holy, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7959:97"/> it did not belonge to euery one to touch or looke into it. The examples of the Bethſamits, and of Oſa are dreadfull for this cauſe; and the cenſor is not put into the hands of all the world. He who can take it let him take it, it is ſayde of one of the Euangelicall counſells; and all conceaue not this word; it is ſpoken vpon the ſame ſubiect. And the ſcripture it ſelfe doth admonish vs not to vow rashly, ſayeing that it is much better not to vowe at all, then not to render the vowe when it is made. Surely the <hi>Director truely diſ-intereſſed</hi> will neuer ſettle him ſelf in the confidence of à ſoule by ſuch à way. For as Iealouſie is à marke of ſick loue and accompanied with diſtruſt and ſuſpition, ſo they who make vſe of theiſe induſtries to binde ſoules, and oblige them to their perſons, or to their Churches and communities; witneſſe how
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7959:98"/> much they are diſtruſtfull, either of their proper conduct, or of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie of the directed ſoules, which is to dis-oblige them by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them, as the Iealous hate in loueing, for as much as their loue hath all the effects, and all the markes of hatred.</p>

For being not conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, you ought to haue à Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall title. If that your teſtimonials were falſe, ſee you not that this pouertie wherof you complaine is the punishement of your falſitie?

Certes it is well done to be made Preiſt to liue, marrie ſpiritually, not temporally; otherwiſe it were by à prepoſterous order to make the ſpirit ſerue the bodie, and Eternitie time.

Such was Iob, when depriued of all his commodities, hee ſayd with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable courage; our lord gaue mee them, our lord hath taken them from mee, bleſſed bee his name for euer. There bee others who are poore in affection but not in effect; theſe are they, who amidſt the abundance of goods, ſett not their affection vpon them; and who haue nether there hart in riches, nor riches in their hart, like vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, who haue poyſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beeing poyſoned, and who
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7959:121"/> rather poſſeſſe them as depoſitaries and diſpenſors then as proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; Great ſoules, ſayth the ſtoick and who vſe ſiluer plates as if they were of earth, and farr greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe who contented in their reall pouertie, vſe earthen veſſels as if they were of ſiluer.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7959:121"/> to gett out of it to become rich; Such, ſaith the Apoſtle, are ſubiect to fall into the ſnares and ambushes of the Diuell, and into miſerable deſires which plunge men into death, deſires which kill the sloathfull, ſaith the wiſe-man, who are gnawen therwith as with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; and theſe laſt are they who ordinarily become importune by the continuall complaints which they make of their pouerty, calling heauen and earth to witneſſe. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom the Apoſtle calls ſwolne, prowde, couetous, more louers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues then of God. Shall I ſpeak it in à word.

There is an other ſort, who are rich in effect and not in affection; becauſe deſiting nothing more then that which God hath giuen them, they poſſeſſe treaſures, in their cofers, but not in their minds; ready to leaue them, or keepe them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as God shall pleaſe to recall
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7959:122"/> them, or leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their cuſtodie. There is à third kind, which are rich in affection, and not in effect; theſe are ſuch as fill the ayre with their complaints, and importune mens eares with their lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; for that hauing the affection wholy inſected with the deſire of riches, which they want, they doe nothing elſe but aſpire, ſigh, and hunt after their acquiſition, placing their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraigne good in things, the bad vſe wherof leads many inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons, into the greateſt euill.

For firſt, this not happening vnto you by your owne choiſe (where there is all wayes, how pure ſoeuer the intention bee, ſome kind of proprietie) but by the ſole diuine ordinance, adorable in all his wayes; ſee you not that this ſufferance would be very perfect, and mount vp as the ſmoake of the

This excellent and holy perſon then ſaith, that the Cenobites draw that which is neceſſary for their liueli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hood foure wayes, which may be reduced to two kinds of regular life; the one, of thoſe who are founded and rented; the other of ſuch as are called Mendicants, and who liue by their begging. The firſt then of theſe foure ſorts, is of thoſe who liue by their labour and induſtry, buying and ſelling to draw from thence profitt, wherby to liue; Theſe are Bellarmines owne words; The ſecond of thoſe who liue on the goods which they haue brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the community, wherof they make à ſtock, which afterwards they diſtribute vnto the brothers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their neceſſities without hauing any thing proper.

Of the three firſt ſorts, liue ſuch as begg not; and of the laſt, ſuch as haue by their inſtitute, the title of Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. Now in the foure chapters following, the Cardinall whom I haue cited, proues as learnedly as the Monks; firſt that they are not obliged to labour with their hands, as the ancient Cenobites did.

Though the ſonne of God called it ſweete and light, hauing himſelfe caried it on his shoulders all the dayes of his life.

But perhapps you groane vnder the sharpneſſe of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall incommodties which preſſe you. When S. Bennett, to ouercome à temptation caſt him ſelfe all naked amongſt the thornes, and S.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7959:130"/> to complaine the one of the priking of the thornes, the other of the coldneſſe of the ſnow? And hee who would plung himſelfe into à riuer to wash himſelfe, should hee haue reaſon to complaine that water wett. I Neuer yet hard ſay that faſting glutts, nor that pouerty inrisheth, roſes growe not but amongſt thornes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there is no day but hath his night, All vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in action, and in action hard and difficult: if vowed pouerty bee à vertue, (of which noe man doubts) muſt it not haue, as chaſtity, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Patience, Humilitie, and all the other vertues, ſome ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or labour annexed to the practiſe therof, otherwiſe what merit were there to exerciſe it? The proper action then of vertuous pouerty, is to ſuffer patiently and ioyfully ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, wants and ſcarcities. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is pouerty, ſaid à great ſtoick, if

Why, ô Cenobite, can you well thinke to haue the glory of an honorable pouerty without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the diſcommodities therof? Are you ignorant that crownes, are not to be gotten but by lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batts? And would you gaine that of pouerty without being prickt with the points of neceſſities? Is it to be à delicate ſoldier that you were inrowled vnder the ſtandard of the Croſſe? Doe you imiagine that it would ſuffice to honour God with your lipps and to ſacrifice vnto him ſolemne words, without putting your ſelfe into the practiſe? He who voweth Chaſtity, ought he not to reſiſt ſenſuall temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? And if he feele them as did S. Paule, ought he not to haue recourſe vnto grace, to the end his vertue be perfected in

He who promiſeth obedience ought he not to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſuffer à thouſand contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and repugnances in himſelf to attaine vnto à perfect reſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, mortification, and an intire renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of his owne will. And would then he who vowes pouerty haue for nothing (to wit, without ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) this pretious pearle? Is it not to acquire it, and for its loue, that he hath renounced all the ſubſtance of his goods? For I ſpeake heere of Prieſts Cenobites, who I ſuppoſe haue left ſome poſſeſſions in the world, not of ſuch as hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gaine much more then they looſe, by puting themſelues into Cloiſters; and then of what doth he complaine? If he feele the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of this voluntary circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might not one ſay vnto him in ſome ſort, as vnto Saphira, it was lawfull for thee to keepe thine owne and to

Peraduenture my Brother you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in this life the hundred fold which our Sauiour promiſed to S. Peter, to his Diſciple, and to ſuch as shall leaue all to follow him; but ſee you not that this intention would be impure and too mercenary, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to giue an almes but in hope of this hundred fold, and after this reckning is there an vſerer or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man who hath not bene libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to giue one for à hundred? If you complaine repining at what you haue left, it is yet worſe, for it is à kinde of reproach made vnto God, to whom we haue rendred in the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7959:132"/> perſon of the poore, that onely which we haue receaued from him; for what temporall, corporall, or ſpirituall thing doe we inioy which we haue nor receaued? And if wee haue receaued it from him what do wee giue him? Are not thes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, which naturally returne vnto the Sea fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they draw their Origen? And moreouer what neede hath he of our goods? If wee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> call ours this title portion of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers which is all his, wherof he onely permitts vs the vſe; ſo the Spouſe who was wholy her beloueds in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hart, and affection, did she not confeſſe that hauing giuen all the ſubſtance of her houſe for the loue she bare him, she thought to haue done nothing: Were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that an Euangelicall Nazarite, à ſoule conſecrated to God, by à vowe ſo holy, could amidſt the Manna of the deſert of Cenobiticall life,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7959:132"/> long after the ognyons and flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots of Egipt? Would one foule his feete after he hath washed them? would one put on againe his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after he were vncloathed? It is to vſurpe the very Words of Iob, but in à far contrary ſenſe, who will graunt mee to be as in my daies paſt when I washed my feet with butter, and the rock powred mee riuers of oile? This is to imitate the cowes who thought to ouerturne the Arke which they drew when the voice of theire calues reſounded in theire eares. If perchance, ô Cenobite, you are poore in the world, and being brought vp in ſtudy by your community you are arriued to the ſtate of Preiſthood, vnder the title of pouerty, and afterwards imploied by your Superiour in the direction of ſoules deuoted to your Order, what cauſe haue you to complaine of à title which hath honored you
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7959:133"/> with the character which you beare and could not obtaine in the world for want of meanes? Is it that the incommodities of pouerty ſeeme vnto you leſſe ſupportable in the ſeruice of IESVS-CHRIST, then in the world? behold, behold him vnto whom you are dedicated, behold your Captaine, and iudge whether you bee more poore and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated then he; It is à yoak which he beares with you, and it would not be à yoak vnleſſe you were two who carried it, for grace is neuer wanting vnto him who is not wanting vnto grace. Grace which cauſeth this yoak to putrefy, (it is the word of à Prophett, which is to ſay, ſweeten) at the face of oile, to witt, by the ſuauety of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Paule, in labour, in trauell, in watchings, in hunger, in faſtings, in cold, in nakedneſſe, in pouerty, in anguish, in miſery, in affliction, as dead yet liuing: or whether we haue receaued ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence or priuiledge which frees

You will ſay with this Learned Cardinall, that the ſame was good and practiſed in thoſe auntient Monaſteries, as wel of Egipt as of the other parts of the world, where many liued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, not hundreds onely, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Monkes according to the report of hiſtories, who were all Laicks, their Superiour onely excepted, who for reuerence vnto the Sacerdotall dignity was called Abbot, which is to ſay, father: But ſince that Prieſthood began to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply amongſt Monks, the vſe of the labour of handes is not onely Leſned, but abolished amongſt the Prieſts; let vs add, and euen amongſt the laye brothers, who in imitation of the fathers, haue left the labour of handes to apply themſelues to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7959:136"/> holy contemplation, and the prayer of reſt and recollection where they doe wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders; becauſe the holy Ghoſt who is ſimplicity it ſelfe, is pleaſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate himſelfe vnto ſimple ſpiritts; Notwithſtanding I referre my ſelfe vnto what S.

It is noe waies to the purpoſe that in this life (he ſpeakes of the Cenobiticall) where the Senatours (theſe were the greateſt Lords of the Roman Common wealth) are laborious, and take paines, the artificers should grow idle, and doe nothing, and where the Lords of villages reſort forſaking their goods, their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes and commaunds, there the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7959:137"/> downe, who were their vaſſalls, should liue daintily; Is not this delicat sloth in your iudgement touched with à delicate hand? No, no, ſaith he in the ſame booke, you muſt not in this ſort be idle, but rather show vnto men by your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that you haue not choſen this kind of life to ſpend your dayes in sloth and idleneſſe, but rather enter heauen by the narrow gate which is that of ſufferances and labours; otherwiſe this ſaying of the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell will beate your eares, what doe you heere all the day without doing any thing?

And what kinde of <hi>Directors</hi> are they, who know not how to guide them ſelues? But ſome will reply, it is of the pouerty of the houſe they complaine, not of their owne particular.

If he were acquainted with theſe incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities during his nouiship why did he become profeſſed, and hauing made his profeſſion, why did he giue teſtemony of his repentance by his complaints? If the preſſing neceſſities of the houſe or of the order were concealed from him, was he ſinceerly dealt withall? Is it after à manner as they vſe to call haukes to the fiſt to hood them, and to cauſe fish to enter into the wicker? ſome are ſo ſollicitous to vnderſtand à nouice, to ſound the

And beſides, in ſaying after à ſighing, and as it were, reproching manner, that Charity is growne very cold, giues occaſion to the world to examen whether it be actiue or paſſiue, to witt whether it be their owne or that of ſeculars,

For there is noe coale ſo dead which is not reinkindled by the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of one that is burning; ſo the Charity of Cenobites when it is true excites that of the people, who of all the Rules of the law vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand none ſo well as this; I giue to the end thou mayſt giue vnto mee, I doe well, becauſe thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokeſt mee ſo to doe.

Is it enough to be called mendicants, to liue onely of almes brought in without going to ſeeke them? enough to nourishons ſelfe of things asked, without humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to aske them?

The Bishop hath à Preiſt for aſſiſtant, the Preiſt à Deacon, but it is the functions of the holy Altar, in the diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and other ſacred Miniſteries, not in the ſeruice of the common life: For who euer heard ſay (vnles it be by abuſe, and prophanation which ought rather to be deteſted, then reduced to example) that à Preiſt is ſeruant, or better to expres my ſelfe, à drudge of the Bishop, and à Deacon, drudge of the Preiſt,

The Preiſt which aſſiſts (for ſo ought one to ſaye, and not to ſerue) the Bishop at the Altar, the Deacon, and the Subdeacon, who aſſiſt the Preiſt in diuine offices, haue they not their part in the ſame office, as the holy ceremonies, and order of ſinging, whether of the Epiſtle, whether of the Ghoſpell, whether of other parts, ſufficiently

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Whether they be exempt from the labour of hands.</head>
                  <p>BVT it is no ſmall queſtion to know whether the Church permitting them to begge as well themſelues as for theſe whom they ſerue, exempt them from labouring with their hands, and from liuing of their labour, or from liuing onely by begging. Let no man thinke that I deſire to moue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſeeking here, according to that auntient Prouerbe, à mite to deuide, and knotts in à bull-rush. For there is queſtion here of their conſcience, and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, of the good of their ſoules. I knowe that S. Thomas in the litle worke which he compoſed to refute the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of thoſe, who in his time
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7959:181"/> roſe vp and wrote againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Mendicants Cenobites was very eager to shew, that the Mendicants are not obliged, like the auntient Ancorites, and Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, to take paines with their hands: A doctrine which hath beene receaued with applauſes, and almoſt Canoniſed, or made Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, like à diuine Oracle, by ſuch as haue exactly practiſed it, by à moſt delicate Saboth. But when this good and Angelicall Saint gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues his reaſon therof, and of this exemption from the labour of hands, wherby to gaine ones liuing, he onely applies it vnto thoſe, who adminiſter the Sacraments, who preach a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d teach iuſtice vnto others, preſuppoſing that this labour much more excellent then the Manuell, merits very litle, if it giues not liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood vnto him that doth vſe it. Beſides, nether he nor Bellarmine,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7959:181"/> who followeth his doctrine in the booke of munks, in the fourth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, will not haue thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the functions of preaching, and adminiſtration of Sacraments to demaund any thing as due vnto them of Iuſtice or equitie, but onely of pure charity, as it is for pure charitie, and not by obligation (vnles it be that of their inſtitute) they render theſe good offices vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſoules: Whence I draw theſe arguments; that if amongſt Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants, onely ſuch as labour ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the ſeruice of ſoules, are exempt from the labour of hands, and who may demaund their liuing though of mere charitie, and not by any title of Iuſtice; what shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7959:182"/> able to performe them, as the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothers, the very name of laicks ſufficiently declaring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to be any part of the Eccleſiaſticall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Shall ſuch in conſcience be exempt from labouring with their hands, and from ſuſteining their life by their labour, hauing both health, and abilitie to worke; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie will one ſaie that manuell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and of hands, as vnbefitting Preiſts, is in ſome ſort forbidden them, and conſequently, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Cenobites, ſuch as beare this carracter are therhence exempted though they performe not the clericall functions. For the difference betwixt particular Preiſts not Cenobites, and Cenobites, is very notable, becauſe they haue, or ought to haue, an Eccleſiaſticall, or patrimoniall title ſufficient to mainteine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without practiſing, or exerciſing mecanicke arts. But
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7959:182"/> the Cenobiticall Preiſts haue no other then that of their pouertie, and mendicity, which hath bene onely approued by the Church, in regard their inſtitute, applies, and appoints them to the ſeruice of ſoules, and the helpe of Paſtours, as well in the adminiſtration of Sacraments, as of the word of God. Let then ſuch as goe not à begging, nor performe the ſeruices of the howſe, like lay-brothers; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe nor preach, nor aſſiſts ſoules, conſider by what right they drinke and eate, the ſweate, and labour aſwell of lay-brothers, as of the preachers, and Confeſſors of their howſe, and whether the ſeraphicall founder of the Minors would not haue put them into the Order of brother-Flyes. I doe not ſay this ſo much to reprehend them, as to aduertiſe them to thinke of the accompt which they shall render
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7959:183"/> for hauing liued in the lande of Saints, of the labour of others; and for hauing embraced à profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and inſtitute which they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe not; and for being of the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the children of Ephrem, who made à faire shewe, but knew not how to fight. Let them remember that God hates the peace of thoſe whom he hath deſtined to warr, and that euery tree (witnes the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree curſed by our Sauiour) that beares not fruite according to its kinde, is in danger to be cut downe and reduced into ashes. It is not enough to weare the habit of à mendicant, to haue the out-ſide of à preacher, Confeſſor, Director; the cauſe is knowne by the effects; and by the fruite the tree. It is not likewiſe ſufficient to beare fruites, if they are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7959:183"/> of the Read Sea, which haue the out-ſide, and apparence of fruites, but within are onely filled with duſt, winde, and ſmoake. Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they vnto whom I ſpeake, will mocke at the charitable aduiſe I giue them, but God, whom no man derides without punishement, may chance one day to laugh to their loſſe, in cauſing them to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der à reaſon of their dealing, and demanding of them fruites accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their kinde; that is, fruites of preaching, direction, and ſeruice of ſoules, according to the inſtitute wherof they haue made profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and receaued their ſuſteinance, and entertainement. The litle bees want not this iudgement, to chaſe away from their hiue, the lazie droanes, which are willing to eate the hony, but are not induſtrious to make it. But the Cenobiticall profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath this defect, that one cannot ſende
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7959:184"/> out of the hiue of the Cloiſter ſuch as are vnprofitable, and theſe fatt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellies, which haue nether backe nor feete to goe à begging, nor tongue nor ſpirit to ſpeake and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, in à word, who haue nether mouth nor ſpirit, and who are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good to fill vp à number, and to conſume the goods of the earth which they enioy, like that tree of the Ghoſpell, vnfruitfully. For touching the poore laick, I am not ignorant that they labour much, and peraduenture no leſſe then Iſrael vnder the maiſters of the workes of the king of Egipt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubtiltie, which the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, aduantagiously vſe towards the ignorant, and the ſimple, to make them carry the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they would not touch with the tip of the finger, is not vnknowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; and we ſufficiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that euery man who labours
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7959:184"/> in what ſort ſoeuer, is worthy of his hire. We commiſerate theſe poore beggers when we ſee them carry, like poore beaſts of burthen, the ſinne which the people redeeme by almes. And percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce take more compaſſion then they who imploy them, and for whom they trauell; I would onely ſeeke their inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the right which they might haue to demaund their liuing without being ſubiect to the labour of other men; and I doe not beleeue that they can finde it in any other place, then in the happines which they enioy in ſpending their dayes, being faſtened therevnto by the nayles of vowes, in ſeruing the Angells of the Lord of hoſts, which are the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobiticall Preiſts imployed in the adminiſtration of Sacraments, the diſtribution of the word of God, and in the ſeruice of ſoules for the aide of Paſtors. After this ſorte they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Be you then very humble, ô brother-ſeruants, and take à good conſideration of your ſelues, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſince you nether are, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be admitted vnto ſacred Orders, whether in regard of the rancke you holde amongſt the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobites, or els out of your inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for learning, you are but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothers, and ſeruants, to the Preiſts of your Orders, though it be ſaid that in ſome of your Inſtituts they of your condition may be Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of howſes, of Prouinces, and likewiſe beare the qualitie, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in this condition of ſeruants you eate, in ſome ſort, the bread of thoſe whom you ſerue, ſince it is by them, and for them that you haue right to begg it, and in this manner as the true balme is made by taking the quinteſence of all liquors, practiſe this ſaying of S.

But it is not the principall function of ſuch as are ſayd to be obliged by their Inſtitutes, to Clericall actions. And let not theſe Chanters alleage vnto
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7959:187"/> vs, that by this diuiſion of Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites of the Quire, and the Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites of the Chaire, and of the Confeſſionary, their Orders are like vnto that Sulamite in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, where are ſeene nothing but Quires of combatans, and armies of Quireſters. And this example ſo often reſounded, and this colewort, ſo many times ſodd, of the hands of Moyſes, eleuated whilſt Ioſue fought. For to ouerturne theſe fayre excuſes on the faces of thoſe who couer themſelues with theſe idle pretenſes; I aske of them, if in à battaille or combate there were fiue hundred trompetts which should ſounde the charge to fiue or ſixe Champions, who should fight by themſelues, were it not à ridiculous thing? And if Ioſue with ſo many thouſands of Iſraelites had lifted vp their hands towards the holy places, that is to ſaie, towards

Prayer is good, tis true, it workes miracles, or rather obteines that God workes them; but it is in ſuch as are aſſigned to à contemplatiue life.

That which is the death of one creature is the nourishment of an other; the very flies, and litle wormes ſerue for foode vnto the ſmall birds: the variety of creatures extreamly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth

If it be ſo, as there are great appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; is it not rather our parts to admire this diſpoſition then to controlle it? Who knowe whether God permitts not this multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mendicant Orders, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of that which is called Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall, the Church ſaying in the prayer of its holie Inſtitutor that God by his merits doth amplifie the Church from time to time, by the increaſe of new iſſue, for to exerciſe the liberall charitie of the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7959:192"/> giuers, by the quantitie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who ſay with S.

In nowiſe, no more then feathers are à burthen to birds, for without that waight they would not be light, nor lift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vp into the aire. To receaue the Prophetes of God, is it not to receaue God himſelfe, Who hath ſaid, whatſoeuer you shall doe vnto the leaſt of theſe, shewing the poore, it is to me the good deede is done? And beſides if there were no other reaſon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God permitts, and the Church approues it, who will not kiſſe the earth vnder this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Who would demaund rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons after this will, as if this will, were not reaſon it ſelfe? Reaſon infinitly diuine, aboue all humane reaſon. I haue not likewiſe ſett forth all which I haue alleaged, to iuſtifie
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7959:193"/> this authority, knowing that this is à tearing rocke, which cauſeth all the veſſells which ſtrike againſt it, to ſuffer shipwracke, and that it is à moſt foolish temerity, and too preſumptious audacitie, to extoll ones iudgment aboue that which is ordained by this ſupreame Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; theſe are the very words of à father of the Church. But I onely deſired to ſownde whether they who vſe this facultie of begging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hath beene graunted to their inſtitutes to containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within the limits preſcribed them, and whether they performe the functions, in conſideration wherof they obteined this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This is of fact wherof one may diſpute, the other of right, which is to be reuerenced in ſo much as he who ſearcheth the Maieſty, is opreſt with glorie. Now as à riuer how deepe ſo euer its

It often happens that the fauours which haue beene shewen to ſaints, and worthy perſonages who haue had the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, and who haue made good vſe therof, paſſe vnto their ſucceſſours, who are indeede heires of their habits, not of their manners, of their rules, and of

And ſo that which hath bene done for the good, and profitable, abuſiuely ſerues the bad, and vnprofitable: Which we reade in the cronicle of an excellent Order, which I will not name; For as in à time of great contagion, the Cenobites ſung the Litanies neare the tombe of their bleſſed founder, and repeated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerstimes, ô our holie father pray for vs; à voice came forth of the ſepulcher, which anſweared vnto theſe Cenobites, farre differing in their manners from the Sainctity of their inſtitute: Nether am I your father, nor are you my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by which he reproched them defect of their obſeruance, and how much they were fallen from the firſt charity of thoſe who had eſtablished their Order, which heretofore had bene ſo flourishing.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The origine and Inſtitution of Medicants.</head>
                  <p>FOR it is true that the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Mendicants, as of choiſe compainies; and, if one muſt ſo ſay, of troope of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tairs, and light horſmen, haue bene admitted in the Church (which before had onely approued foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Cenobites) to preach, and adminiſter Sacraments by miſſion, and permiſſion and for the aide and eaſe of Paſtours: There conſiſts the principall end of their inſtitutes, and not to ſing, or to imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the ſeruice of the Quire, for which cauſe they are not ſo neceſſary vnto Paſtours, nor in the conduct of ſoules, ſince that ſo many other Cenobites liuing of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7959:195"/> foundations, ſo laudablie exerciſe themſelues therin: So that if now for one preacher and Confeſſour there are founde amongſt them thirtie, as well Choriſts, as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothers, euen amongſt the moſt reformed, who ſee not, that herein they exceede the limmits of the Churches intention, which neuer was to ſende vs ſo many Chanters, of whom one may ſaie, as the Spartan ſayed of the nighting all: Thou art onely voice and nothing elſe. And indeed of theſe foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Orders which beare the title of Mendicants, there are three (two of which haue the rule of S. Auſten) which no wayes mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth mendicitie: Yet leſſe that of S. Baſile, of which there are ſo many Cenobites in the eaſt who liue of their poſſeſſions or rents, or of the labour of their hands. The firſt then which bore the ſtandart of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7959:195"/> mendicity in the Church, was that great, and Seraphicall Saint, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Minours who was therin contradicted, yea with in his owne Order which was ſifted, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſince his time by thoſe who would liue of foundations, and thoſe who would remaine in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous obſeruance of the letter, of this holie rule, which was giuen him from heauen, as vnto an other Moyſes vpon the mount Aluerne as the Chronicles report. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Preachers who being of the Order of S. Auſten, called Cannon Regulars, carried the banner of preaching againſt the Albigeois, and à great frind of the Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Inſtitutor of the Minours, could hardly approue of this mendicity, vntill he had ſeene the ſplendor of the Diuine Prouidence to appeare in that famous Chapter of Nattes ſo well diſcribed in the admirable
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7959:196"/> Cronicles of Minors, where ſo many thouſands of Religions liued of the Almes brought them from all parts without their demaunding it; à miracle compared to that of the multitude nourished in the deſart, by the loaues which our Sauiour multiplied. For then the bleſſed founder of Preachers ſeeing the great aduantage of the mendicity, aboue all rents, and reuenneues, not onely renounced thoſe which he poſſeſſed (in ſo much as his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but then begun, had not he heaped vp much together) as alſo thoſe which he might poſſeſſe; to cauſe his Diſciples to followe the ſame kinde of life, as that of the Minours. The heremites of Saint Auſten, and them of S. Baſile, vnder the title of the mountaine of Elie, followed this trace, and ſo they framed amongſt themſelues in the Church, in the compaſe of foure
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7959:196"/> ages, theſe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re Mendicante com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities; three of which haue not begun their Inſtitute in mendicitie, but onely in imitation of that of Minours, who concerning their Inſtitution being the laſt in the date of time, were the firſt in the practiſe of mendicitie, which vntill that time, had not bene in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Order. This noueltie ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp certaine ſpirits, tranſported with à bitter zeale without diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I might alſo ſay, without ſcience, but they had too much of it, not of that of Saints grounded in charitie which edifieth, but of that which puffeth vp, and which cauſeth ſuch as poſſeſſe it, to ſinne, and makes them to receaue condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their owne iudgement. Theſe wrote venomous inuectiues, full of coller, &amp; boldnes, againſt theſe holie Inſtitutes, againſt whom S. Thomas compoſed thoſe diuine
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7959:197"/> treatiſes which ſerue for ſworde, and buckle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The authoritie, learning, and pietie of this great Saint, who was indeede, rather an Angell, then à man, rendred the names of the Authours of theſe Satyrs, infamous; Who had done like the Giants of the Poets, burying themſelues vnder the mountaines which they themſelues had raiſed. For he tourned their dolour, and iniquitie, vpon their owne heads, with ſo much efficacie, as he cut off, without recouery, the heads of this hydra, for euer ſtopping the mouth of all detracters, by his thirtee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th opuſcule, and the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, out of which he afterwards drewe, thoſe excellent reſolutions which he brings touching the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobiticall Mendicitie, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of hands, in the 186. queſtion:

Farr be it then from me to touch vpon this Cenobiticall Mendicitie, and this exemption from the labour of hands, ſo well defended, and by ſo many reaſons, and authorities, as, if I should be ſo ill minded, as in this point (from which God preſerue me) to iuſtle or reprehend them, I were not able; and if I might, truely I would not for all the world hurt, or giue à shocke vnto fraternall charitie. But reprehending the bad vſe of a good whence ariſe theſe vniuſt complaints of ſome <hi>Cenobiticall Directors,</hi> I thinke not to offend à condition altogether holy, and which is not culpable of the faults of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, who make ill vſe of the happynes which they enioy to be therin placed, complaining to ill pourpoſe of ſuffering ſome incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, inſeparable to the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant pouertie, which by à modeſt

Thomas adds, that three cauſes might authoriſe mendicitie, and make it lawfull, euen in the world it ſelfe. The firſt, humilitie, which he proues by the example of thoſe who being great, and rich, for to doe penance, and to humble themſelues vow to make pilgrimages asking of almes.

And why ſayed he in theſe three caſes, that which is permitted to ſeculars, shall it not be ſo to the Mendicant Cenobites? certes that ſtrongly, argues for thoſe who haue left their honours, and their goods in the world, to liue in humilitie, &amp; pouertie in the ſeruice of God, and for the Preachers, and <hi>Directors</hi> of ſoules, who by their inſtitution make bridges to paſſe into heauen, &amp; edifie walls, to witt the manners of the ſpirituall ſeruſalem. Let them who are more penetrating then my ſelfe, obſerue whether that agree vnto thoſe who haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, knowe nothing, nor doe any ſeruice at all to ſoules. And

In fine there is no queſtion of knowing whether the exemption, from the labour of hands, graunted to Cenobites, who ſerue ſoules with permiſſion to begge, be good; for the bare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their inſtitute, done by the Church, or by her head ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declares it: But onely whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they who weare the ſame habit, and performe not that function, ought to enioy this Cenobiticall priuiledge; and whereas the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, of what ſoeuer condition they be, haue permiſſion to worke, and not that of begging; whether they are in ſtate of being able to liue o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:7959:205"/> Regulars, who are not imployed in the ſeruice of ſoules, and who otherwayes are ſtrong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, haue power to begge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labouring. And it muſt not be ſayd that they labour, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them that labour; for firſt it were neceſſary for them to proue, that they who labour in the ſeruice of ſoules, hauing made the vowe of pouertie, and mendicity, haue right to cauſe themſelues to be ſerued, and their needes to be demaunded by their ſeruants, which we haue here aboue weighed; and beſides that, they should shewe that the Church had giuen them power to liue of their labour, who attend to the inſtruction, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people. Of an expreſſe permiſſion of this, I knowe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that she ſuffers it, I ſee, and it is that which ſtayes me, and that which makes me, as in matter
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7959:205"/> of fayth, to render my vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding captiue, and reduce my reaſon into ſeruitude. Poſſibly one will ſay, that in founded communities there are ſtore of Lay-brothers, oblates, Conuerts, Seruants, (call them as you pleaſe) who liue of the ſeruice which they re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der vnto thoſe of the Quire. And for à particular example they holde by auntient traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Abbay where S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard was Superiour, that in the time of this eminent perſon (one of the greateſt lights which hath appeared in the Church ſince the Apoſtles) there were 700. Cenobites, 300. of the Quire, and 400. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothers, which is gathered euen by the number of chaires, or fomes which are in the Quire, 300. for thoſe that attend to the pſalmodie, and the diuine offices; and 400. which are in the body of the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7959:206"/> Church; where the Conuerts were ſeated. But there is à great chaos, and an extreame difference in this poynt, betweene the founded Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobites, &amp; the Mendicants: For the founded liue of their owne, be it by the good husbandry of their anceſtors, be it of that they haue brought vnto the ſtocke of the Communitie, be it of their proper labour, be it of certaine donations, or pious legacies giuen by great Lords, or rich perſons. They make the beſt of their lands, they culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate their poſſeſſions, gather their rents, and in ſumme without being chargable either to publique, or particulars, they liue as priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the world, of their reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues: In caſe of warr, famine, or plague, of tempeſts, firings, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, and many other loſſes, and misfortunes wherof this life is full, they faſt, ſuffer, and ſuſteine theſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7959:206"/> diſaſters without other aſſiſtance, then from their frinds &amp; parents, without burthening the publique. Euen vnto Clareuallis it ſelf from whence we haue taken the example, one may ſaye, that their reuennues proceede rather of the labour and good husbandry of Cenobites, as well Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uetrs, as thoſe of the Quire, then of the liberalities of great men, who truly haue giuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ſome thing, but farr from the maine. For then the brother ſeruants labouring co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proprietie, or particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, faſting, and perpetually mortifying themſelues, and ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at nothing, but the ſeruice of God and the communitie; this vnion was able to heape together enough to purchaſe à Prouince, if they had not laboured according to the counſell of S. Paul to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the needy, to whom they had
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7959:207"/> more care to giue almes, then to inlarge their poſſeſſions. Even they who are honoured with the dignitie of Preiſt-hood were not exempt from the labour of hands, as is eaſily gathered out of many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of S. Bernard, which he cutts of in the middeſt of à diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours in regard of the bell which called the community of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts to worke. And in the very rule of S. Bennet it is ſayed, that the Scapular (both common to Preiſts, and Conuerts) is à kinde of garment proper for the labour of hands. Vnto all this I add, that if à Conuent be founded with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reuennues to mainteine its conuentualls, they haue no more obligation to corporall labour, then rich ſeculars; the Conuerts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their duty in ſeruing the Preiſts: and Choriſts of their howſe, performing their office, ſince that

It is not ſo with the mendicant Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, who beſides that, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe à more ſtrict pouertie, ſince it reacheth euen to the communitie, which cannot poſſeſſe any immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable, are yet obliged by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes to the ſeruice of the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, in the adminiſtration of the word of God, and of Sacraments, for the aide of Paſtours, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof, they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to demaund their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo that the people be not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; which may happen by the ſuperfluous number of the brother-Conuerts, and of thoſe who onely ſerue in the Quire; for which cauſe principally they were not eſtablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in the Church. Beſides, in caſe
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7959:208"/> of the three ſcourges of plague, warr, and famine, when they finde not their neceſſaries in particular howſes, they repaire vnto the body of cities which haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to be mainteyned at the expence of the publique, where they finde liberal aſſiſtance. Obſerue now by this difference whether they who ſerue but in the Quire amongſt the Mendicants, as alſo the Lay-brother or Conuerts who are onely imployed to begge for the Preachers, and Confeſſors of their Orders, ſatisfie by this ſeruice the foundation of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and the intention of the Church which approued them; or whether they haue any obligation to worke, I ſaye, to gayne, at leaſt, part of their liuing, by the labour of their hands, at times when they are not imployed in theſe ſeruices. For put the caſe,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7959:208"/> that à brother-ſeruant, should not goe à begging but one day in the weeke, and should reſt the other ſixe, would he ſatisfye his rule, or the commaundemnt of God, which ordeyneth that one labour ſixe dayes, appoynting onely the ſeauenth for repoſe? And if the Choriſt after ſeauen howres alowed ordinarily for ſleepe, beſtoweth three or foure, in ſinging in the quire, what shall become of the thirteene which remayne of the foure and twentie. For foure houres of the alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſinging, doe they require twentie to take breath? Touching Preachers and Directors of ſoules, it is not the ſame, in ſo much as, according to the quicknes, or dulnes of ſpirits there be ſome to whom the function of preacing coſteth litle time, and ſtudy, and others who labour ſtrangely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They haue alwayes theyr mindes bent vnto their ſermons, and there be ſuch, who ſpend all the yeare to pollish and prepare the ſermons of one Aduent, or one lent. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Directors, they are to tyed by the eares, and occupied in ſuch ſort, and (if one may ſay ſo) proſtituted to all thoſe that demaunde them, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto them, diuiding to euery houre, and pourpoſe the the waters of their ſcience through places diſtributing the fountaynes of their doctrine, according to the ſpirituall needs of ſoules, which conſult with them, as they can onely diſpoſe of ſome moments here and there ſpiritually, if they be attentiue, to viſite priſoners, the ſicke, miſerable perſons, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and who haue neede of

Let vs ſaye then for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Choriſts, and brother-Conuers, that if their conſcience reprehends them not, and that they finde themſelues reaſonably charged with profitable labour, and which may redound to the aduantage, whether ſpirituall, or temporall, of thoſe from whom they demaund their maintenance, they ought to remayne in peace, and onely ſet before their eyes, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobiticall ſtate being à very liuely image of the terreſtriall, or celeſtiall Paradice according to the ample compariſons which S. Anthony in his ſumme, and S. Ierome Platus in the 4. Chap. of his 3. booke of the happines of the Cenobiticall life, make thereof; yet fayle they to liue there without labour; for though the kingdome of God conſiſts not
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7959:210"/> in meate and drinke, but of ioye, and peace in the holie Ghoſt, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe euen in the ſtate of in noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, and in à garden of delight-which produced fruite in all ſeaſons, our firſt father was placed therin by the hande of God to labour, and keepe it. It is true ſay the morrall diuines that the traueiller is exempt from faſting which is of precept, but that is to be vnderſtood, if the toyle of the iorney be ſuch as takes away the neceſſary forces to ſuſteyne faſting, together which the payne of traveill. In your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he that should ryde at his eaſe vpon à good horſe, or in à coach, would he haue cauſe of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from faſting? And if the man who makes à great and long voyage à foote, but by too litle iourneys as à league or two in à day, according to the condition of his perſons shall he haue occaſion to breake the faſt?
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7959:210"/> And if he reſt himſelfe whole dayes, during that time of repoſe, shall he not be obliged to faſt? Say the ſame of thoſe who amongſt the mendica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſerue onely in the Quire, or to goe à begging whether this labour be ſuch vnto them as it may be incompatible with all other, they haue with out doubte right to liue of their mendicity according to the permiſſion which the Church giues to their Orderes. If it be not ſoe, there is ſome reaſon to doubte thereof, whoſe deciſion I ſeaue to our Maſters.

Beholde two of weight and meaſure, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceuable
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7959:211"/> as I beleeue, by euery iuſt-Spirit. The firſt reaſon is, that for the moſt part the Lay-brothers as leaſt iudicious, and aduiſed, are they who more lowdly ſounde fourth the complaynts of their pouertie, when they want ſome thing which they eſteeme to be needfull for them. I would now willingly shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their injuſtice, and that they haue yet much leſſe right to complaine, then to demaunde, by the proofes which we haue brought: The which I ſaye in caſe that the complaints proceede from their owne motion. But for ſo much as oftentimes they are but the ecchoes of the voyce of thoſe who ſend them to begg, and who are vnited with them in the ſame <hi>intereſts,</hi> and reſembling two violls which reſounde in the ſelf ſame time, though there be but one of them touched, or thoſe poore Twins which Plinie mentioneth,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:7959:212"/> wherof the one communicats vnto the other the nourishment. Doe you not conceaue that I ought to refute in them the complaints which the Cenobiticall Directors cauſe to be made, of the neceſſity, and needs of the litle communitie? But beholde à reaſon which ſeemes to me more powerfull then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedent; which is, that there are many of theſe brother-Conuerts, &amp; more of thoſe that ſerue onely in the Quire, and no wayes in preaching, nor in confeſſing, who intrude themſelues into the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall direction, and conduct of ſome deuoute perſons, with no leſſe bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denes then impertinence, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other are ſupportable. For if one ignorant leade an other, what will followe, but that they both tumble into the pitt of ignorance? Who will not blame the audacitie of thoſe
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7959:212"/> who without authoritie, put their hande to the Cenſor, and without the ſcience of the voice, ſecretly vſurpe the Office of teaching in the Church, making themſelues ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, not being able to be trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in the howſe of God?

Such as are erected in howſes of Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, carry themſelues with more prudence, I knowe not whether with more ſimplicity, the diſorder therin doth ſo much appeare, and paraduenture intereſt raignes leſſe there. I ſpeake here to the end one may vnderſtand me, of thoſe deuoute confraternities, and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of perſons, meerly Laicks, and

There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chappells appointed for the aſſemblies of theſe Confraternities, there is an Order eſtablished, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers created as well for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, as for the temporall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Societies (for there are ſome which haue foundations) to the end that all there march in good order, as is well beſeeming thoſe who aſpire vnto true pietie,

                  <p>THey merit yet leſſe to be ſought for Directours who haue regard vnto the apparence of perſons, an imperfection ſo much blamed in ſcripture, principally in the epiſtles of S.

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:7959:232"/> the rich, and deſpiſe the poore, which he concludes in thoſe words, whoſoeuer is an excepter of perſons commits ſinne, and is reprehended, by the lawe, as à tranſgreſſour. And I pray you to what purpoſe, shall the ſpirituall Directour, who ought to regard onely God, in à ſoule, or a ſoule in God, take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, not of his body, but of his goods, which are onely made for the tranſitory life of the body? Meate is made for the belly, and the bellie to receaue the meate, but God will diſtroy both the one and the other. Beſides is it not God who hath made both the great and litle, as the wiſe-man teacheth vs, and who hath the ſame care of the litle as of the great? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then shall à Paſtour, à ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Directour be he à particular Preiſt, be he Cenobite, called into ſome part of the ſolicitude of ſoules
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:7959:232"/> by the Prince of Paſtours, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of our ſoules, ſwarue from the modell, which is shewed him, vpon the mountaine of perfection, hauing more attention, and care for the rich, then for the poore. Is he ignorant that our Sauiour came to Euangelize the poore, and that he giues for à marke of his coming unto the diſciples of his precurſor, carry tidings to your Maſter that the poore are Euangelized. And himſelfe in the daies of his flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of his conuerſation amongſt men, did he not deſire to be, and appreare poore? In his birth, in his life, in his death, there is nothing but litleneſſe, and poorenes; he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelfe to be held for the ſonne of à carpenter, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds his Apoſtles that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt the litle ones to come vnto him, and declares vnto them that if they become not like vnto litle
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:7959:233"/> Children, they shall haue no part in his kingdome. He calls the poore bleſſed and allotts them hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for their heritage, &amp; promiſeth this aduantage vnto ſuch as for his loue shall haue embraced pouertie, to make them to ſit vpon ſeates, and to cauſe them to iudge the whole world. It is the eternall wiſdome who heretofore ſayd by the mouth of the wiſeman, that his familiar conuerſation was with the ſimple and litle ones, and that his ſpirit reſted not but vpon the poore, the humble, &amp; thoſe that feared him. It was in mud the ſacred fire of the Temple was founde by Iſrael at their retourne from the captiuitie of Babilon, and certes, it is in the dreggs of the people, to wit, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the poore, and the litle ones, rather then amongſt the rich, and the great men of the world, that the fire of charity, and of true pietie is

And if the Director hath the true zeale of ſoules, (which one may call the pure flowre of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) though he ſifte them neuer ſo much, yet will he finde that the litle ones haue the fatnes of the wheate of deuotion, and that the great ones ordinarily haue but the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, the ſtraue, the noiſe, the cracke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſolidity, for ſo much as the good ſeede, is ſuffocated in their harts, by the thornes of vanities and ſollicitudes of the world.

Vpon à time one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:7959:234"/> à Philoſopher, that none but of his ſecte, who then made profeſſion of contemning goods, were to be ſeene at the gates of the rich, he anſweared with more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie then truth, that they went as Phiſitions vnto the moſt infirme, meaning that they carryed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their philoſophie, which ſerued as ſo many remedies againſt vices, vnto ſuch as were moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therwith: But one replied vnto him with more truth then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, that they went thither truly, like Phiſitions, rather for gaynes then to reſtore health. The ſame may be ſayed of ſpirituall <hi>Directors,</hi> of what condition ſoeuer they be, when à man ſees them ſo carefull of thoſe from whom they may expect ſome profit, and ſo litle attentiue to the ſeruice of the poore. For though they could couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the excuſe of the Philoſopher,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:7959:234"/> in ſaying that they runn vnto thoſe, who being more engaged, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the vices of the world, haue more neede of helpe; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles it is apparent, that this is à falſe pretence, and that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are different from their words. For if they ſay true, why doe they not, like the blood which runs to the defectiue, or moſt feeble part? The litle ones, the poore, and the miſerable, are ordinarily the moſt neceſſitous, I doe not ſay tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, that is cleare, but ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the moſt part of their vices growe, forwant of inſtruction; for if they did knowe the deformitie of ſinn they would haue it in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and this horrour, would diuert them from committing it. If they doe ill, it is by the corruption of nature, rather then by à foule, and deliberate malice, and for that no body shewes vnto them the good
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:7959:235"/> which they ought to followe, and the vice which they ought to flye, they oftentimes doe more good the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knowe of, where as the great ones and the rich, much better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, neuer committ euill, but they knowe it, and knowe much more good, then they doe.</p>

Therupon I replied vnto him, that the caſe was much altered, ſince in times paſt, his howſe raiſed the Abbay and now the Abbay depending of his howſe, of miſtres, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſeruant, tributary and as à wofull farme. Beholde how by theſe changes the face of the world is tourned. The Directour truly <hi>dis-intereſſed,</hi> will diſcourſe ſoberly of Almes, where he shall thinke it fit to be ſpoken of, when his aduiſe is required, he will shun as à rocke, his particular profit, ſetling à true order in the charitie of the ſoule which he conducts. And what is the true order, but that with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute Cardinall Bellarmine in the laſt chapter of his booke of Monks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drawes from the Doctrine of S.

                     </gap>; almes is ſo much the more accompanied with iudgment, in reſpect that God is then ſerued, not onely with his ſubſtance, but alſo with the ſpirit, by the diſcretion of the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I will shutt vp this paſſage with à notable conſideration of my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed father, the great Francis of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Bishop of Geneua. He was vpon à time called into one of the principall cities of this ſtate, to diſtribute there the word of God. As being the Adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of harts, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with deuotion, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly accoaſted, by diuers myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and ſpirituall bees, which ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aboute the ſacred flowers of the documents of his mouth, to drawe from thence à honie of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Of them he ſawe diuers ſortes and guided by different handes.
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:7959:242"/> Now this man who was all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelfe, hauing caſt his eyes vpon the workmen who laboured in the vinyeard of this citie, as well by their publique ſermons, as by their priuate directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, tooke prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall notice of two, who by two wayes quite contrary, yet holie, aimed at the ſame butt, which was to eleuate the ſoules vnder their conduct, to à ſolide pietie. The one was Cenobite, of an Order very renowned and examplar, the other Eccleſiaſticke, of the Clergie, liuing of à patrimony much more ample then the reuennue, which he had of his benifice. The firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the ſoules which put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder his conduct, by the way of feare, of rigour, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior auſterity, and helde them too ſubiect, and tied to their exerciſes, as nothing could happen, though neuer ſo litle, to put them out of
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:7959:243"/> their courſe without cauſing them to enter into troubles, into ſcruples into remorces, into bitternes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which were ſtrange. Beſides they were ſo ſtrongly tied vnto this Confeſſour (and by themſelues: for this truly pious perſon was for his owne particular very dis-intereſſed) that they would haue thought it à great crime to regard, or conſult which an other. Theſe perſons vſed much prayer, &amp; mortification, but viſited very few hoſpitalls, priſons, poore, and neceſſitous; alwayes in the Churches, at diuine offices, at Sermons, at Indulgences, inſatiable therein: Not that almes came not out of their purſes, but the greateſt part went to the holy community of the Directour, who therof had no greater share then the reſt, though he were next vnto God, the principall motiue of this aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. He was an enemy of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:7959:243"/> and of preſents which were addreſſed vnto him, remitting all to the Superiour of the howſe, who cauſed this precept exactly to be kept by the communitie, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any thing, and to demaund nothing: For the communitie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer demaunds, yet well may the particular for the community, as à member labouring for the whole body. Moreouer theſe ſoules did iudgement, and Iuſtice, by the feare which they had of the iudgements, and juſtices of God, not certes by that feare which excludes loue, but by the ſame which being put in the ballance with this, turnes the ſcales. Now as the thunder tearing the clowds, cauſeth them to diſſolue into rayne, and prepareth the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to disburthen themſelues of of their calues, as ſayeth the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt according to the interpretation of S. Hierome: and as he who is
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:7959:244"/> purſued by à bull, by à maſtife, or by ſome furious beaſt, caſts him his cloake, to ſaue himſelfe by flight: So there is nothing which doth ſo much perſwade to redeeme ſinns by the workes of mercy as feare: For when the terror of hell ſeiſeth on à ſoule, and cauſeth her to conceaue what it is to lodge in the deuour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fires, and in the eternall fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; is there any thing which she will not giue, for her deliuery, as ſaieth Iob? O God ſaieth Dauid thou haſt moued the earth, and thou haſt troubled it, heale the contritions therof; for it is greatly moued. He ſpeakes of à ſoule faſtned to the earth. And if the fire which cauſeth the meate to roſte, looſeneth the flesh from the bones, how much more will the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that of hell ſeperate à ſoule from earthly affections? O God, no, I doe not ſay that this holie
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:7959:244"/> perſon had in theſe terrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, ſo baſe à thought; but as the effects doe not alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the intentions, paraduenture theſe ſoules as the ſcholers of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Philoſopher tooke that by the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, which he preſented by the right, wherfore I preſent the effect of this cauſe of what deſigne ſoeuer it was animated. The ſoules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wiſe, which God had inſpired to range themſelues vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of à ſimple Preiſt (the which I ſaye to ſerue my ſelfe of the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vſe, not conceiuing à Cenobite to be à double Preiſt) were incited by an other ſpirit; which was that of ſimplicity which excludeth not wiſdome, and of that charitie which as the Apoſtle ſayeth chaſeth away all ſeruile and ſcupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous feare, onely hauing in their harts, that which in the ſcripture is called chaſte, and holie, and which
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7959:245"/> ought to continue euen in eternitie it ſelfe. Charity was their predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſtarr, and as the roofe of their miſticall edifice; and humilitie their foundation. Sweetnes and candor shined in their deportments and docility, which the Apoſtle calls diuine, was in their ſpirits, and they being diſingaged of exteriour thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs enioyed that interiour freedome of which it is ſaied, where the ſpirit of God is, there is true liberty. They loued God with all reſpect, and with à high and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and their neighbour in God tenderly, &amp; cordially. They viſited the poore, the widdowes, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, the ſicke which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccour, in their miſerable cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, or in the hoſpitalls: and if they had any feare, it was of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, neuer approaching the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall but with trembling, as if he had bene that Cherubin armed
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7959:245"/> with à firye ſword, keeping the gate of the terreſtrial Paradice. And though he inſpired into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, onely loue and charity, and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto them nothing ſo much as à mutuall beneuolence in God, according to the ſo frequent leſſon of our Sauiour, and of his well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued diſciple, yet neuertheles their confidence in him, was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſo much reuerence, as it was à wonder that this banished not the other. Beſides he was ſo farr from all <hi>Intereſt,</hi> be it of dominion, be it of profit, as to auoid the ſame, he commanded them oftentimes to take ſome other Confeſſour, to the end his counſelles might be the more aſſured, if they were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by others, or that he might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, in caſe they were in any ſort doubtfull, or defectiue: And to shun what ſoeuer tends to profit, his aduice extended it ſelfe to all,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7959:246"/> except the diſtribution of their goods, telling them that it was à caſe reſerued to the vnction of the holie Ghoſt, who teacheth his waies to the mercifull and meeke. Yes, for is it not he who infuſeth charity into harts, and who eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth therin conuenient Order; enemie of preſents both great and ſmall, hauing learned of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that they blinde the ſpirit of the moſt wiſe; and eſtranged from all profit, not onely ſordid, but alſo that which being permitted by the moſt ſeuere lawes, cannot be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med dishoneſt without offending the Church it ſelfe, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the vſe and rule therof. Alſo he was prouided of goods of fortune to enioy this beatitude which conſiſts in giuing rather then receauing, and content with foode and apparrell ſutable to his condition, he held nothing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7959:246"/> more aduantagious then ſufficiency with pietie, that which ſeemed profitable vnto others, vnto him was à detriment for IESVS-CHRIST; being certaine that they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ſome recompence of their labours in this world, abate ſo much of that which attends them in the other. He forbade noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſeuerely to thoſe who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, as to take gratification of ſuch as came to obteine of him ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rituall aſſiſtances; and if any one tooke libertie ſo farr forth as to receaue the leaſt thing, he wished him not the leproſie of Giezi, but of the religation of Agar he was aſſured; he gaue him his paſport not to haue any part in this Anathema which he had in no leſſe horror, then that of Acan. Breifly, not to draw more in le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght the deffences of theſe Directours, beholde the iudgment of the holie
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:7959:247"/> Prelate, from whom I take this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Theſe two men ſaied he, were both of them prudent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, and who taught iuſtice vnto ſoules by diuers waies. Such as were conducted by the firſt, had much feare of God, and much charitie towards their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, or at leaſt for his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and their charitie was in the Order. They of the ſecond had much loue of God, and of their neighbour, and the Order conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in their charitie, and they had much feare and reſpect of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour, who beſides the neceſſary conferences for their needs in the howſe of God, had no other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate entertaynements, nor any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, nor conuerſations in howſes; which is the propertie of corrupted, and vnſauory ſalt. Both of them had God before their eyes, and for the onely obiect of their intentions,

There is but one greife which touches me to the hart, which is, that this poore boye died, before I could haue the meanes, to make him knowe, at leaſt at the extremitie of his life, the eſteeme which I made of his vallour; certes it was wholie other in my hart, then in my tongue, for that bleſſed him, whileſt with this, I ſpake vnto him iniuries, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, able to take away the courage from the moſt generous.

The words of praiſe are alwayes ſuſpected of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and S.

But if it be permitted to the Scotiſts in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:7959:263"/> very ſublime, to contradict the opinions of this great Sainte, the honour, glory, and Oracle of the ſchooles, it will be much more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this ſubiect which is no wiſe of fayth, but rather of fact, then of right, more narrowly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether this reproache be lawfull, or of more baſe alloy. The which we shall perceiue by diuers markes, whereof beholde the firſt. What ſeeke the Paſtours, whether Dioceſans, or Curates, or ſimple Preiſts ſubordinate to them? (This is that which is called the Order of the Clergie) in the charge of ſoules? If you beleeue the words of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, and rash iudgements of ſome Cenobites (I ſaye of ſome, well knowing, that there are amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them truly Saints, and whoſe words are no leſſe reſerued, then their life exemplar) without doubte they ſeeke nothing therin but honour,

If I would cite the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours who vſe this odious la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, I should cauſe whole Orders to blush, but the reſpect I beare vnto the good, hinders me from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying according to their temeritie to theſe temerarious Iudges: I will neuertheles ſpeake the truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the appearence of perſons, (à vice which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready blamed) but with all poſſible charity. Now before the entrance into this ſlipperie paſſage, I had neede to declare here, that I doe not compare the bad Paſtours, that is, ſuch as dishonour their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by their ſcandalous life, with the good Cenobites, for the weapons would not be equall: Nether will I ſpeake of vnrulie, or diſ-ordered Cenobites, to witt, who no wayes obſerue their rules, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe violate, and breake them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in euery poynt, with the good

But we doe not here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare vertuous perſons, with the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues; we will ſpeake onely of the duty which the truly vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in theſe occurrences; and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:7959:269"/> when I ſaie, duty, I meane that of the charge, and obligation of the office. When the Cenobites shall retire themſelues vnder the lee, who can ſaie vnto them, why doe you ſo? Why flie you, why doe you abandon the ſterne dureing the tempeſt, ſince that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth no waies tye nor oblige them therunto. But the Paſtour cannot without an ignominious and shamfull decay of his reputation, ſtrike ſaile, nor auoyde the combat; and ſince there are certaine ſallies of courage, and valiancy, nowiſe coming from true valour, which ought to proceede from à ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudgement, from à ſetled deliberation, and from à tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of à conſtant, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious minde in the place of danger. Theſe impetuous paſſions, which coller, and rage ſtirr vp in duells; theſe ſallies which push-on ſo many
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:7959:269"/> ſoldiers into battailes &amp; aſſaults, are ſeldome animated but by the bruite of the example of others, of the out cryes of the multitude, of the clattering of armes, of the ſounde of drumms, of fiſtles, and trumpets; of the thounder of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and musket shotts; ſuch à one heated and headlong runns into it, who would neuer haue thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe forward in colde blood, and vpon conſideration. Euen <hi>Intereſts</hi> themſelues, whether glorious or profitable, are ſometimes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall motiues of this valour. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which conſiſts in à temperate mediocritie, hath none of theſe ſudden motions: Its fyre is equall; its light is like that of the ſunne, by ſweete ſucceſſiue rayes, not like that of ſtarrs, which produce not, or if one may ſo ſay, bring not forth theirs but by ſparklings. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſees not that à continuall
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7959:270"/> ſobrietie, and exactly obſerued, and à moderate faſt according to the lawes of the Church, is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, then thoſe exceſſes of abſtinences which ſome violently vſe, though ſeldome enough, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faſting two or three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, eating but once a day à litle bread, and drinking onely à litle water, ſometimes abſteyning out-of ceremony from all meate which had life; ſometimes all concocted nourishment, ſometimes eating onely when the ſtarrs appeare, and when theſe dayes are paſt, from whence they are drawen by force, as men vſe to doe from bad wayes, nothing but diſcorders are to be ſeene in their dyet, whether for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, or quantitie; and was it not for this cauſe that God ſaid by à Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that he liked not the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of ſome Iewes, becauſe in the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:7959:270"/> dayes of their faſts, he founde them filled with their proper wills? For the ſame reaſon he reiected their Sabothes, and their feaſts. God willeth that euery plant produce fruite according to its kinde, and in due ſeaſons, and that its leaues fall not away. I doe not ſpeake this any wayes to diminish the value, and luſtre of the great actions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes which ſometimes Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites performe, for the ſeruice of ſoules, and of the Church; be it in miſſions amongſt hereticks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells; be it to extend the faith, and to powre it out into the harts of Barbarians, and Sauages, to the fartheſt parts of the earth, the which Hierom Platus moſt amplie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in the 12. booke of the happines of the Cenobiticall ſtate. But I ſay that the continuall, and vninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſeruice of good, and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Paſtours, though of leſſe
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:7959:271"/> noiſe, is not of leſſe fruite, ſince that to preſerue their goods alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acquired, is no leſſe vertue then to get new. The Comets, are more apparent then the ſtarrs, yet no man dares to compare them, to the ſtarrs of heauen, no more then the fires of the earth, to the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary which is aboue the region of the ayer, albeit the effects of the ſame which is with vs, eſpecially that of thunder aſtonisheth vs much more. And it was for that cauſe that the Precurſour of the Meſſias, leading à Sauage and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life, from the commerce of men, was of greater eſteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Iewes, then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe, whence they did not accknowledge him, though he were daily in the middeſt of them. And if beſides this ordinary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dutie which the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours render vnto their sheepe,

For concerning the two other vowes, of Chaſtity, and obedience, no man doubtes but that Preiſts, as Preiſts, performe them more ſolemly, in regard they are tied, and annexed vnto the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Order, then the Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, as ſimple Cenobites. And beſides for that of pouertie we haue already declared how much its
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:7959:272"/> aduantage is balanced by the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent qualities of the ſingular, and ſecular pouertie. Peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ſome will reply according to the new diuinitie beyond-ſea (the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prelats of the Gallicane Church, and the Sorbon, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently noteing that wherof I ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke) that Cenobites ſeruing ſoules without obligation (which is true) and without <hi>Intereſt</hi> (which is the thing in queſtion) render more pure ſeruice then the Paſtours, who are obliged thervnto by office, by ſtate, and by duty of iuſtice; and that this purity extreamly exaltes their charity. But to retort this argument which ſeemes plauſible, on the face of thoſe that propoſe it, I ſaie firſt, that though charity be without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie the greateſt of all vertues, the ſcripture declaring it in expres tearmes, ſuch à caſe may neuertheles happen, that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

I ſaie in the ſecond place, that this purity of Charity, as ſome take it, is rather an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or to ſpeake more mildly, an imperfection in Charity; for being free and voluntary without obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is alwaies ſome mingling of proper will, which will endure no yoake nor tye, and which ſaith, though moſt ſecretly: I will not ſerue, or elſe in magnifying its to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, ſaieth our lipps are our owne, who is our Maiſter? Who is he that hath right to commaunde vs? But beholde the force of the reply, if it followe that the Cenobite hath
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:7959:273"/> à more pure Charity in ſeruing ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les then the Paſtour, becauſe he is not therevnto obliged by duty, and Iuſtice; it will followe that the Layck, and Secular, liuing in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie pouerty, and obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any obligation of vowe, shall ſerue God more purely, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly then the Cenobite with all his vowes, which being made, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him by duty and Iuſtice, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto the God of Iacob, the vowes which the lipps haue diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly pronounced, which were to deſtroy the maximes of the who ſchoole, abuſe the ſainctity, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of vowes, and of vowed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:7959:275"/> and of obligation of Iuſtice, which before was but voluntary; and which change Counſell into commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; why altering the battery, will they that Charitie (the ſunne of vertues, and in whoſe preſence all other vertues, both diuine, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane haue no more light then the ſtarrs in the preſence of the Planet that makes the day,) be not ſo much the more excellent, as she is the more neceſſary, and that she ought to be exerciſed by ſtate, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iuſtice? Chaſtitie, before it be vowed, is but of counſell, he that will followe it, let him followe it; who shall be without neceſſity, and maſter of his will, and in power to embrace it, let him embrace it; ſince it is good for à man to be ſo, and better to liue in continency, then to engage himſelfe in nuptiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: It is notwithſtanding but of Counſell ſaieth the Apoſtle

But after it is promiſed vnto God, one may not violate his faith without acquiring his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The ſame may one ſay of that degree of charitie which obligeth Paſtours by office.

Why, ſaie I, shall not we auerre, that this vertue exerciſed by duty, and obligation of Iuſtice, is
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:7959:276"/> more excellent then when it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed euen in the ſame degree, but without any obligation, then that bond of the proper will, which may without ſinne, aſwell withdrawe it ſelfe from this good, as to apply it ſelfe therunto?

It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto fathers &amp; mothers to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their children in their armes, and on their boſome, as it is written of Benjamin the well-beloued of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, who repoſed on the breaſt of his father. This tender and pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall feeling cauſed S. Paul to ſay, my litle children whom I trauelle withall, vntill CHRIST IESVS be formed in you. Now it is moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Paſtours alone are charged with ſoules, and lincke their ſaluation, with that of their sheepe: That wihch made S. Hierom to ſay, writing to à perſon vnreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued whether he should become à Monke, or remaine in the Clergie; If thou wilt be à monke, what doe you in the Cities? The very name of monke, which is as much to ſay, as ſolitarie, doth it not call thee to the deſart? But if thou wilt be à Clarke, to wit, Preiſt, or Paſtour,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:7959:278"/> liue in ſuch ſorte that in the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, thou mayeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage thyne owne.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding whileſt they deſire the direction of ſoules without charge, leauing vnto Paſtours as the beaſts of burthen, the charge without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, who ſees not that they ſucke, and drawe the milke of sheepe, that is to ſay, of people, and after they haue taken away the creame, they leaue the curds, and whaye, vnto Paſtours, like vnto thoſe children to whom honny is giuen vpon their bread, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lickt vp the honny, caſt away the bread? Is not this à pleaſing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie to goe about to haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, without charge, and without obligation, and to leaue the charge of the office, vnto thoſe who haue ſo ſcanty à share in the benefice, as we will preſently shew? what reaſon
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:7959:279"/> permitts that he feede himſelfe with the flesh of the flocke, and cloake himſelfe with the wooll, who takes not the care to feede it, nor to be accomptable for the ſame? If the ſoule beloſt, immediatly will they ſaie we are cleare of his blood: à ſtrange language, and like to the tone of him who ſayed, am I my brothers guardian: Is not this to immitate the grashopper, which liues of nothing but dewe, in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſweate of the browe of the workmen who haue taken the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard to taske at their perills, and fortunes, and who are accomptable for the ſame vnto the great Maiſter. From thence proceede theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conteſtations, betweene the Paſtours, and the delegated Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, as happened betwixt the shepheards of Loth, and Abraham. The Cenobites imbracing all the Clericall functions without being
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:7959:279"/> ſo much as willing that they of the Clergie should no more caſt their eyes on the Cenobiticall conducte, then if it were an Arke which one durſt nether touch, nor beholde; à man might ſaie of them, that they would imitate Partridges ſo deſirous to become mothers as they take the eggs one from the others: But here there is but one ſorte of partridges, which accommodate themſelues, with the eggs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For that the Paſtours of the Clergie should guide the Cenobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſoule is that which is not ſene, and that which is not tolerable, and that which ſome would call ouerthrowing of all Order, and of all policie: For they haue not the ſpirit of the inſtitute, nether doe they knowe all the litle ſecrets which the world is not worthy of. But that the Cenobites gouerne guide, direct Dioceſes by Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:7959:280"/> authority, when they are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therevnto, and ſecular ſoules by thouſands, be it by preaching, be it by pennance, be it by adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments, particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, and conferences, that brings but ornament, and comfort to the policie, of the Church, and to the Hierarchie. Beſides the partriges which haue as it were diſcloſed the eggs of others, nourish theſe litle ones, as if they had laied them themſelues. But the queſtion is, to knowe whether they who are ſo eager in Directions of the ſoules which are not of their folde, are willing to feede them, or to be fedd by them, as alſo to charge themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with them, or to be anſweara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God for the ſame; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſerue them by way of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enterteynment, and onely of paſſage, or to drawe from them ſome temporall releife. Of which

But I reſt not there, I will that this reproach be verified in ſome perſons (for it cannot be vniuerſally, the Church hauing by the grace of God, ſome Paſtours, ſo litle addicted to the profit of their charges, that they giue vnto the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, more then they receaue of their benefices) what ſiniſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:7959:281"/> of the Apoſtle, all diuinitie and all Iuſtice, which willeth that euery good worke haue its reward. For if there be à ſpirituall mariage (as no man doubteth) betweene the Paſtour and his Church, to wit, the aſſemblie of the faithfull to him committed, there ought to be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall obligation of ſome duties, and that the Paſtour feeding his sheepe with words and examples, and giuing them ſpirituall foode by the ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the voice, should draw from them his temporall mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by à dutie, and obligation of Iuſtice, on their parts towards him. It is not the ſame with Cenobites, who not being tyed by obligation of iuſtice, to any flocke; ſo by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of iuſtice nothing is due vnto them, from the people: And if they render their ſeruice vnto ſoules vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and not by duty nor charge, they may therby receaue

This is not that they ought to murmur at the benefitts which the faithfull beſtow vpon thoſe who ayde and helpe them in the adminiſtration of their charges, if they will not heare this rude, but iuſt diſmiſſion, take that which is yours, and carrie it away, why grumble you? becauſe I am good, what wrong doe I to you, for the fatt of an other? is his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement your ruine?

The Preiſts and the Auntients are conſumed in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and haue demaunded meate, to reuiue their ſoules, and ſuſteyne their life. The moſt noble children of Sion, the Paſtours couered with the prime, and the moſt pure gold of charitie, ſince they are obliged

O mockers how much more iuſtly might one caſt backe your darts of laughter vpon your ſelues, and ſaie, that appearing dead to the world, by this death which is called ciuill, ſcarcly are you well mortified, and making shewe of hauing nothing by your pouertie, rather in shewe then effect, you haue all, you ſucke all, you attract all. And I pray you after this faire diuiſion of the lion, where all is on one ſide, and nothing
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:7959:295"/> on the other, as we haue made to appeare, after that the rented Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites haue drawen vnto their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and tyed to their howſes, all the tithes of Paſtours, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Patronages of parishes, making them their children, and ſeruants, who were heretofore their Fathers, and Maiſters. Doth it well become them in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to call themſelues the poore Euangelicks, to ſaie that the Paſtours, are proprietaries, and poſſeſſours of their owne will; that thy doe nothing but for profit, and diuers other reproaches which I will not relate, and which are no leſſe vniuſt then misbeſeeming, and odious, in mouthes ſo ſweete and ſugared, as ſeeme to breath forth nothing but words of milke, and honnie, and ſo ſacred, that they paſſe all for Oracles of veritie, and for tearmes of humility, and of
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:7959:296"/> charitie. Certes if the Church did ſpeake ſo diſ-aduantagiously of Paſtours, that were more tolerable: for the workes of an aduerſary to true piety, are ſo many flowres, and crownes; but as thoſe bees which make honny ſtinge moſt, ſo the ſtrokes giuen by the hande of à ſuppoſed frinde, wounde more, and carry à blowe ſo much the more ſtrong, as the leſſe foreſeene. This is that which cauſeth ſo ſtrange an imprecation, and which I should not dare to repeate with Dauid, againſt that man who ſecretly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him, though he had liued peaceablie with him, and in all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, euen often to eate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to walke as compagnions in the wayes of God.

Beſides if they were content to haue riſled the Paſtours of the Patronages, and Tythes, which they haue drawen from them, and to haue ceaſed, by their beggings, from depriuing them of the iuſt ſuccours which they might expect of their sheepe. If they were ſatisfied in diuiding
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:7959:297"/> amongſt themſelues, the ſpoyles of the conquered, without making ſo bad vſe of their victory, as to giue to vnderſtand the contrary of that which is, placing darknes in the place of light, and calling thoſe riche, and <hi>Intereſſed</hi> in the ſeruice of ſoules, whom they haue redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to extreamitie of miſery, at leaſt in the Contry; and publishing themſelues poore, to finish the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of the Paſtours of Townes, and to reduce them to the pouertie of their compagnions: One would onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare them to that Sauage Animall which I will not name, and wherof the Prophet ſpeakes, which kicks at its mother as ſonne as she hath giuen it ſucke. But when by ſecret deuices they paſſe from the contempt of Miniſters, to that of the miniſtery, and auert the people from the aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of their parishes, and foment the diſtaſt which they

                  <p>FOr beſides that the Mendica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts called reformed, are alwayes bent to extend their Orders, by new howſes; they who ought to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of foundation, and not of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, are nok leſſe eager to people, and dilate themſelues, which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not doe without may difficulties, and according to the forme of their gouernment. For in lieu of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely thoſe amongſt them (as the woemen doe in their new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries) who should bring their maintenance with them, founding themſelues in this ſorte by litle and
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:7959:299"/> litle, without diſaccommoding any; they receaue indifferently ſuch as bring, or bring not, imagining that it will be as eaſie for them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding boldy, to obteine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as for the Mendicants to get from day to day Almes, for their ordinary liuing. What hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens thereby? beſides the trouble, ſome importunities, which cauſe much murmuring, that fruſtrated of their expectations indiſcreetly conceaued, they moue heauen, and earth, to drawe themſelues out of the ditch of neceſſity, which they themſelues haue digged, And ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtablish and founde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, at what price ſoeuer, they leaue nothing vnattempted. The dying flies, ſayeth the wiſe-man, ſpoyle the ſweetnes of the perfume, he meanes, that when the flies doe but lightly play vp and downe ouer the balme, or ſome other odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:7959:299"/> liquour, it receaues but litle hurt: But when they are taken, and putrifie therin, that changes the puritie of the odour. Yet the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing almes which the mendicants gather are ſupportable according to the capacitie of the places where they eſtablish themſelues: But for thoſe who would founde themſelues without bringing any thing to the communitie, and without doing any thing, nether with their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, nor their husbandry, but onely in begging abroad with courage and boldnes (not to vſe ruder tearmes) it is neceſſary that they take their aime very high, and behold à farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, entire inheritances, deceauing the right or collaterall Heyres, who ſeeing themſelues depriued of their expectations, by miſticall practiſes more temporall then ſpirituall, fill the Aire which complaints, the barrs with ſuites, and the world

To ſpeake the truth, if we were yet in the time of the Churches infancie, when the faithfull brought all their goods without reſeruation, to the feete of the Apoſtles, theſe good perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges who call themſelues our ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the Apoſtles, but not leading an Apoſtolicall life, would quickly compaſe their pretentions; but be it that they haue not altogether, ſo much vertue as the Apoſtles, be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="569" facs="tcp:7959:301"/> the Mendicant Cenobites afford not their ſeruice for nothing, but haue their enterteynment of the people, who doe not principally giue them temporall goods, but firſt in conſideration of God, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends mercy, more them Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and next of the ſpirituall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances which they obteyne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.

And if in the Confeſſionaries, they ſeeme to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie more gratuity, we intreat them to conſider, that at the ſame time they adminiſter the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation vnto à very few ſoules which by inclination, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily put themſelues vnder their Conduct, or which themſelues haue drawen; their brother ſeruants, are at mens gates in the Citie, or in the Contry, demanding indifferently at euety doare, and receauing releife from many howſes wherevnto they render no ſeruice at all.

It is not that I blame this prudence which knowes dexterously how to hide the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, whoſe deformity may decay the luſtre of the reputation of à holy Order, and change this good odour of life, vnto life, which the good example of others doth euery where caſt forth.

And hence it is that the manner of life which the Cenobites leade, giues them the preeminence in the opinion of people, aboue the manner of life which the Paſtours are conſtreined to lead, to ſatisfie the obligations of their charges. For they, shewing themſelues leſſe often to the world, and euen in à manner prepared, compoſed, affected, ſtriking the ſenſe of thoſe who conſidere, and iudge of the interiour man, by the exteriour countenance, as of à tree, by the barke, and the leaues, are

                  <p>THis is that which I thinke to haue made appeare in this writing, by demonſtrations more then Mathematicall, vpon the ground-plott of à litle Dioceſſe, in this prodigeous inequality which I haue shewen; where, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuiſion of the Lyon,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:7959:321"/> which is turned into à prouerbe, the goods of the Church are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all on the Cenobites ſide, and very few on the Paſtours. Beſides I may ſaie, that in compariſon of diuers others, which I knowe well, they are fauourably enough treated, and liberally diuided. For as it is in the great dioceſe where they finde great meanes, ſo is it alſo there where the Paſtours haue bene more ſifted, more reaped, and more largly vintaged, by thoſe who communing onely to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours are become their maiſters, and being onely troupes of ſupply, and ſcatered ranks of the Hierarchy, are in proceſſe of times, and by diuers induſtries, become miſtreſſes of all the goods of te contry, and townes, drawing the tythes, and Eccleſiaſticall poſſeſſions to their ſide, and all the reſt by begging: For I can ſaie with as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:7959:321"/> as truth, ſpeaking gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that is, caſting à view vpon the whole maſſe of goods deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to thoſe who ſerue the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, that the Paſtours haue not the fiftieth part therof. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the labour, that the Cenobites haue not the hundreth part therof. As for the charge of ſoules, that the ſame wholie belongs to Paſtours, who watch ouer them by ſtate, office, and obligation, as being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to render an accompt to the iuſt Iudge: And that the Cenobites haue not any part therin, ſince they caſting vpon the shoulders of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours what ſoeuer is dangerous, difficult, painfull, and burdenſome, reſerue to themſelues, that onely, which is honourable, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the gouerment, and delicate direction of certaine perſonages of choice, and election: And if they ſometimes deſcend to the conduct
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:7959:322"/> of the litle ones, and of the poore, it is by ſtarts, and ſallies which are quickly cooled, and like vnto à fire of ſtrawe shining, but litle heating; ſparkling, but litle burning, flashing, but of litle durance. Let vs caſt an eye vpon the Contry, and aske the Paſtours there, what helpes they obteine from Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites; they will anſwere you, that they who are founded ſerue them to no other purpoſe, then to gather vp the tythes of their parishes, allotting them à moſt miſerable portion therof; And that the Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants ſuffer them to be ſeene, and hearde once, or twice à yeare, in the time of harueſt, whether it be for goods, or for ſoules, I leaue the deciſion therof vnto him that knowes the ſecret of harts. And if ſome at other ſeaſons of the yeare goe vp and downe Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing through villages, which is
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:7959:322"/> no leſſe rare then ſwallowes in the winter, it will be ether to ſatisfie the obligations of ſome foundations deſtined to that exerciſe, or elſe becauſe the muſt of feruour, and the firſt fruites of the ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion is yet warme in the begining of an inſtitute, or of à reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or to aſſiſt ſome eſtablishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or to acquire reputation to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, all this vnder the reſplendent cloake of the glory of God. But when this firſt charitie is paſt, and this firſt boyling growne colde, and faint, farwell my miſſions, and my Catechiſmes. O how the ſweete repoſe, and the holie vacancie of Mary is à much better part, and more deſirable, then the toyle of buſyed Martha; and how good à thing is it to expect ſaluation of God in ſilence and hope?

But the importance is, that the one fights in open feilde, the others by the mine, and by the ſpade: And the play of theſe being more couered, the gaine is greater, and the conduct more ſubtile.

A Directour truly dis-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed will not be offended at this triall, but will ſay vnto God with Dauid; proue me lord, and try me, burne my reynes, and my hart: For as he who tenders good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, nether feares the touch-ſtone, nor the sheeres, though well may
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:7959:332"/> he, who puts away the falſe; ſo he who hath no other aime but God, in the conduct of ſoules, doubteth not the examine which is made of his actions, of his words, no nor of his intentions: For when he should be tried by fire, there will not be founde in him iniquitie. By this examine he who is holie, is yet more ſanctified, and he who is pure, is yet more purified. Golde put into à fornace, is there purged without conſuming; if there be any droſſe it is ſpent in the flame. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, true ſeruant to God, reioyced when he ſawe his lipps purified by à burning cole, which an Angell had taken from the Altar. Theſe are the vlcerated bodies, which dread the shock, and the ſpirits (whoſe vertue is weake) who feare the touch. When the Apoſtle ſaied that he was made à ſpectacle before God, the Angells, and men, you
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:7959:332"/> may thinke that he feared not to be waighed on all ſides, to the end he might be eſteemed as à miniſter of God, and à lawfull diſpenſer of his miſteries.</p>
